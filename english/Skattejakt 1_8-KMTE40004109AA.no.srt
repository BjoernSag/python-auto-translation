2
00: 00: 30,960 -> 00: 00: 34,780
There is no oil in the North Sea.
All the big ones pull out.

3
00: 00: 35,079 -> 00: 00: 38,820
37 dry wells.
We have to get out.

4
00: 00: 39,119 -> 00: 00: 43,459
I understand.
So the problem is the rig?

5
00: 00: 43,759 -> 00: 00: 46,859
We can't handle the rent anymore.
We have to sublet it.

6
00: 00: 47,159 -> 00: 00: 52,419
-To whom? If everyone gives up ...
-Shell might want to drill on block 6/10.

7
00: 00: 52,719 -> 00: 00: 57,539
So I'm going to talk to Shell?
I can reach 13.35 to Houston.

8
00: 00: 57,840 -> 00: 01: 02,240
You have to be where it happens.
In Norway.

9
00: 01: 04,200 -> 00: 01: 08,579
-Stavenger? What kind of place is it?
-Stavanger.

10
00: 01: 08,879 -> 00: 01: 12,859
A small fishing village.
Christianity, rain, cold.

11
00: 01: 13,159 -> 00: 01: 16,579
Not a real summer
or winter. No bars.

12
00: 01: 16,879 -> 00: 01: 22,979
We have an office there for a week's time.
The plane will take off in three hours.

13
00: 01: 23,280 -> 00: 01: 29,019
So I'll get us out
as fast and cheap as possible?

14
00: 01: 29,319 -> 00: 01: 32,719
Votes. Good luck.

15
00: 01: 34,960 -> 00: 01: 36,960
Thanks.

16
00: 01: 38,039 -> 00: 01: 42,619
I hope for a higher position
when i come back.

17
00: 01: 42,920 -> 00: 01: 46,780
-If you manage to fix it.
- Must stay.

18
00: 01: 47,779 -> 00: 01: 49,779
-Nice.
- Thanks, sir.

19
00: 02: 30,680 -> 00: 02: 32,920
-You're welcome.
-Thanks.

20
00: 02: 53,199 -> 00: 02: 55,719
Norwegian texts: Anne M. Standal

21
00: 03: 41,199 -> 00: 03: 44,000
How did you get hold of them?

22
00: 03: 47,639 -> 00: 03: 52,639
I got them by the chef.
Americans do not eat insects.

23
00: 04: 02,599 -> 00: 04: 04,979
-Christian?
-Yes?

24
00: 04: 05,280 -> 00: 04: 08,740
A. Rettedal.
Is it Arne Rettedal?

25
00: 04: 09,039 -> 00: 04: 11,620
Yes, I guess so.

26
00: 04: 11,919 -> 00: 04: 16,019
I didn't know him
should come in our engagement.

27
00: 04: 16,319 -> 00: 04: 17,860
No ...

28
00: 04: 18,160 -> 00: 04: 23,060
Oh my God! I have applied for a job
at the Town Hall, at Rettedal's office!

29
00: 04: 23,360 -> 00: 04: 26,180
I'm not prepared!
What should I do?

30
00: 04: 26,480 -> 00: 04: 30,020
-You can dance with him.
-Do not mess with me.

31
00: 04: 30,319 -> 00: 04: 34,939
- Should I drive you to the hairdresser, Anna?
- No, I can ride a bike.

32
00: 04: 35,240 -> 00: 04: 40,699
Then the hairstyle is destroyed. Christian?
Pick up the items at Vinmonopolet.

33
00: 04: 41,000 -> 00: 04: 43,819
Your suit is hanging in the bathroom.

34
00: 04: 44,120 -> 00: 04: 48,780
Fredrik? It has to go out.
And drive her to the hairdresser.

35
00: 04: 49,779 -> 00: 04: 51,539
-Now?
-Yes, now.

36
00: 04: 51,840 -> 00: 04: 54,660
-Thanks.
-Come.

37
00: 04: 54,959 -> 00: 04: 56,680
Lets see ...

38
00: 04: 57,279 -> 00: 04: 59,759
Christian, remove the stuff!

39
00: 05: 02,800 -> 00: 05: 04,800
Come on.

40
00: 05: 12,160 -> 00: 05: 16,760
Anna came into our lives after
an unhappy relay in Sirdal.

41
00: 05: 16,519 -> 00: 05: 20,899
She ended up under a teammate
and got a concussion.

42
00: 05: 21,199 -> 00: 05: 24,420
Fortunately Christian had
taken first aid course.

43
00: 05: 24,720 -> 00: 05: 30,040
We said it was mandatory.
But that was not it, Christian.

44
00: 05: 31,160 -> 00: 05: 35,460
Anna gets to everything
she decides.

45
00: 05: 35,759 -> 00: 05: 38,579
And Christian has been surprised lately.

46
00: 05: 38,879 -> 00: 05: 42,500
Our only son,
born in a sardine box.

47
00: 05: 42,800 -> 00: 05: 46,400
He has broken
with the family tradition.

48
00: 05: 46,159 -> 00: 05: 50,979
After military service, he got a job
diving in the North Sea.

49
00: 05: 51,279 -> 00: 05: 56,879
Neither I nor Ingrid were
especially supportive of that choice.

50
00: 05: 56,639 -> 00: 06: 01,539
We had been told that the Americans
did not come to hire Norwegians.

51
00: 06: 01,839 -> 00: 06: 04,879
But then they made an exception.

52
00: 06: 12,639 -> 00: 06: 17,860
Martin took the phone and said:
"Yes, yes, yes."

53
00: 06: 18,160 -> 00: 06: 21,580
"I send you the confirmation
 on Monday. "

54
00: 06: 21,879 -> 00: 06: 25,300
He never finishes
with that story.

55
00: 06: 25,600 -> 00: 06: 27,680
Now's your chance.

56
00: 06: 29,360 -> 00: 06: 31,800
Rettedal.

57
00: 06: 34,759 -> 00: 06: 39,800
- It's just congratulations.
-Thanks. Aren't they fine together?

58
00: 06: 51,159 -> 00: 06: 57,439
If this had been labeled,
it would have been drunk right away.

59
00: 08: 24,800 -> 00: 08: 27,560
"I booked a room ..."

60
00: 08: 31,000 -> 00: 08: 35,840
I booked a room.
Jonathan Kay.

61
00: 08: 41,840 -> 00: 08: 46,280
Here are the keys. There's the stairs.
Have a nice day.

62
00: 08: 47,519 -> 00: 08: 50,399
This is our block.

63
00: 08: 51,200 -> 00: 08: 56,540
Here is block 2/4. There main
the office does not want us to drill.

64
00: 08: 56,840 -> 00: 09: 02,340
This has probably been pushed up
of salt and has collapsed in the middle.

65
00: 09: 02,639 -> 00: 09: 07,240
Below it is a cavity.
A possible huge occurrence.

66
00: 09: 07,000 -> 00: 09: 12,419
- They won't even look at it.
- Sometimes you just have to strike.

67
00: 09: 12,720 -> 00: 09: 16,000
-Here? Now?
-Yes, that's the instruction.

68
00: 09: 18,000 -> 00: 09: 21,600
The field is not dead!
They've found hydrocarbons!

69
00: 09: 21,360 -> 00: 09: 23,779
Yes but not much.

70
00: 09: 24,080 -> 00: 09: 28,780
-The Norwegian state requires us to drill.
-The agreement is valid for a few more years.

71
00: 09: 29,080 -> 00: 09: 32,540
If you don't find oil,
Norway will give up.

72
00: 09: 32,840 -> 00: 09: 35,620
A reputation created
of the headquarters in Bartlesville.

73
00: 09: 35,919 -> 00: 09: 41,579
Don't you want us to pull out?
Who am I working for?

74
00: 09: 41,879 -> 00: 09: 43,779
Phillips Petroleum.

75
00: 09: 44,080 -> 00: 09: 47,280
They sent me
to pull us out.

76
00: 09: 47,399 -> 00: 09: 50,819
Who are they"?
Are they more important than me?

77
00: 09: 51,120 -> 00: 09: 54,720
-Hovedkontoret. They pay me.
-I can pay you.

78
00: 09: 54,480 -> 00: 10: 00,320
What do you have? Three employees?
The money comes from Bartlesville.

79
00: 10: 03,440 -> 00: 10: 09,880
What now? Are you going to Shell
to sublease Ocean Viking?

80
00: 10: 10,480 -> 00: 10: 17,620
Yes. If Shell decides
to drill on 6/10, it can be good for everyone.

81
00: 10: 17,919 -> 00: 10: 23,559
How many powers they have given you
to subsidize Shell's success?

82
00: 10: 23,360 -> 00: 10: 25,779
You're still hoping to find something, Ed.

83
00: 10: 26,080 -> 00: 10: 30,259
Do you know how many dry wells
our country has drilled?

84
00: 10: 30,559 -> 00: 10: 32,559
470 000.

85
00: 10: 35,480 -> 00: 10: 39,000
So giving up after 37 is weak.

86
00: 10: 41,000 -> 00: 10: 44,860
You have to be tough
to grow, Jonathan.

87
00: 10: 45,159 -> 00: 10: 48,259
- Have you talked to people in Shell?
-Yes.

88
00: 10: 48,559 -> 00: 10: 52,719
I'm talking to Shell
just as it is.

89
00: 10: 57,399 -> 00: 11: 00,959
It's your tax card.

90
00: 11: 13,559 -> 00: 11: 17,199
-Where are you going?
-I need to talk to Shell.

91
00: 11: 27,399 -> 00: 11: 33,159
<i> Diver 1, you're in the process </i>
        

        to exceed the dive time of 15 min. </ I>

92
00: 11: 36,559 -> 00: 11: 39,799
Diver 1, do you hear me? </ I>

93
00: 11: 42,279 -> 00: 11: 46,000
I repeat:
        

        Diver 1, do you hear me? </ I>

94
00: 11: 49,879 -> 00: 11: 53,460
<i> Get into the dive clock </i>
        

        <i> right away! </ I>

95
00: 11: 53,759 -> 00: 11: 57,480
Diver 1 here.
You are strong and clear.

96
00: 12: 03,799 -> 00: 12: 06,199
Dive in the clock!

97
00: 12: 09,759 -> 00: 12: 12,399
- Raise the clock.
-Time?

98
00: 12: 15,039 -> 00: 12: 17,179
15 1/2 minutes.

99
00: 12: 17,480 -> 00: 12: 21,840
We are no longer recovering
if we don't stretch the knit sometimes.

100
00: 12: 31,639 -> 00: 12: 34,899
Christian?
What is "three beers" in Norwegian?

101
00: 12: 35,200 -> 00: 12: 37,640
"Three beers".

102
00: 12: 38,240 -> 00: 12: 40,539
And that check pick?

103
00: 12: 40,840 -> 00: 12: 43,500
"Play ludo".

104
00: 12: 43,799 -> 00: 12: 47,679
- "Do you want to come home and play ludo?"
- "Play ludo"?

105
00: 13: 02,360 -> 00: 13: 04,680
"Play ludo".

106
00: 13: 06,200 -> 00: 13: 11,540
We have a problem.
This may be our last job in Norway.

107
00: 13: 11,840 -> 00: 13: 17,700
Phillips has sent a lawyer from the United States
which must get them resolved from the contract.

108
00: 13: 18,000 -> 00: 13: 21,899
-We'll pull us out of Norway.
-Our contract, then?

109
00: 13: 22,200 -> 00: 13: 25,940
- The Santa Barbara gang joins us.
-The others, then?

110
00: 13: 26,240 -> 00: 13: 28,919
I do not know.

111
00: 14: 26,440 -> 00: 14: 28,820
- Remember to ask your father.
-Yes.

112
00: 14: 29,120 -> 00: 14: 34,379
I got the job! Had to take dictation and
stenographers in English and French!

113
00: 14: 34,679 -> 00: 14: 38,379
I'm not good at French,
but I got it anyway.

114
00: 14: 38,679 -> 00: 14: 41,539
- Shall we go home to you?
-To you.

115
00: 14: 41,840 -> 00: 14: 46,560
If you want bread slice
with liver paste for dinner, then.

116
00: 14: 47,919 -> 00: 14: 50,559
-What is wrong?
-Its nothing.

117
00: 14: 50,360 -> 00: 14: 56,639
Why don't you go home?
It's Thursday and Nyman has a roast.

118
00: 14: 58,440 -> 00: 15: 03,300
Phillips pulls out.
We will not drill the last well.

119
00: 15: 03,600 -> 00: 15: 06,200
Then dad gets right.

120
00: 15: 07,639 -> 00: 15: 10,720
Everyone is going to laugh at me.

121
00: 15: 15,679 -> 00: 15: 21,120
Finally, I find something I'm good at,
and then nothing comes of it.

122
00: 15: 21,960 -> 00: 15: 25,379
-Pardon.
-I realize you're sorry.

123
00: 15: 25,679 -> 00: 15: 28,399
And I realize you're happy.

124
00: 15: 29,840 -> 00: 15: 32,040
It is your turn.

125
00: 15: 32,159 -> 00: 15: 36,399
- Shall we go to bed?
-It is your turn.

126
00: 15: 38,759 -> 00: 15: 41,200
Christian ...

127
00: 15: 50,759 -> 00: 15: 53,840
Was that all?

128
00: 16: 01,759 -> 00: 16: 04,200
-Hi. Nice car.
-Yes thank you.

129
00: 16: 07,960 -> 00: 16: 09,879
Hey Hey.

130
00: 16: 22,039 -> 00: 16: 24,579
We can't hold on like that!

131
00: 16: 24,879 -> 00: 16: 30,879
-"There's no shame in turning around?"
- We need longer to get hold of the fish.

132
00: 16: 32,240 -> 00: 16: 37,779
-We were expecting you home yesterday.
-Yes, we went to Anna.

133
00: 16: 38,080 -> 00: 16: 42.680
Martin asked me to talk to you.
He is looking for a job.

134
00: 16: 42,440 -> 00: 16: 48,220
- Is it true that Phillips is giving up?
-We do not know. He wants to prepare.

135
00: 16: 48,519 -> 00: 16: 52,559
-What about you?
-I ... wait and see.

136
00: 16: 53,440 -> 00: 16: 57,260
No harm
to work up from the floor.

137
00: 16: 57,559 -> 00: 17: 00,019
What should I say to Martin, then?

138
00: 17: 00,320 -> 00: 17: 05,220
That we do not hire for the time being.
We change the operation.

139
00: 17: 05,519 -> 00: 17: 08,440
Why?

140
00: 17: 09,200 -> 00: 17: 12,580
A little fish.

141
00: 17: 12,880 -> 00: 17: 16,420
-I did not know that.
- I haven't said anything.

142
00: 17: 16,720 -> 00: 17: 19,900
Mom doesn't like change.

143
00: 17: 20,200 -> 00: 17: 23,400
Right? You ...

144
00: 17: 39,920 -> 00: 17: 44,200
-Do you want one?
-Yes, since you ask.

145
00: 17: 45,119 -> 00: 17: 48,259
What is going on?

146
00: 17: 48,559 -> 00: 17: 52,859
We have been sitting too long
on the fence and waited.

147
00: 17: 53,160 -> 00: 17: 56,340
Bjelland turned into a freezer
a year ago.

148
00: 17: 56,640 -> 00: 18: 00,580
-Fish outside Scotland.
- Has Dad been too slow again?

149
00: 18: 00,880 -> 00: 18: 03,980
When you take over,
you must keep up with the times.

150
00: 18: 04,279 -> 00: 18: 10,720
You can't have a boss who's stupid
more than the staff. Father knows that too.

151
00: 18: 23,720 -> 00: 18: 31,400
The name Jesus never fades,
is devoured by the tooth of time.

152
00: 18: 32,799 -> 00: 18: 40,919
The name Jesus, it is eternal,
no one can erase it.

153
00: 18: 42,519 -> 00: 18: 50,519
It has bids for young, old,
still shooting fresh shots.

154
00: 18: 51,839 -> 00: 19: 00,000
It has the ability to gather
all souls come in to God.

155
00: 19: 01,599 -> 00: 19: 10,259
The name Jesus I must love,
it has set my soul on fire.

156
00: 19: 10,559 -> 00: 19: 19,119
By that name I found salvation,
no other salvation can.

157
00: 19: 39,799 -> 00: 19: 45,700
Phillips Petroleum headquarters, please.
Bartlesville. Oklahoma.

158
00: 19: 46,000 -> 00: 19: 48,759
Legal department.

159
00: 19: 52,680 -> 00: 19: 56,180
Jonathan Kay.
I want to talk to Carson.

160
00: 19: 56,480 -> 00: 20: 00,140
Hello.
Yes it is going well.

161
00: 20: 00,440 -> 00: 20: 02,740
There is only one thing ...

162
00: 20: 03,039 -> 00: 20: 07,319
Ed Young believes that 2/4 is promising.

163
00: 20: 09,559 -> 00: 20: 11,799
But ...

164
00: 20: 13,279 -> 00: 20: 17,599
Yes, well ... I understand.

165
00: 20: 19,000 -> 00: 20: 21,339
We follow the plan. Oh well.

166
00: 20: 21,640 -> 00: 20: 27,980
If we pull out, and another
operator in ten years finds oil in 2/4 ...

167
00: 20: 28,279 -> 00: 20: 32,420
-What do you say then?
- That you were right and we were wrong.

168
00: 20: 32,720 -> 00: 20: 38,579
When the man from Shell comes around
one minute, you see the answer in his face.

169
00: 20: 38,880 -> 00: 20: 41,100
Are you hoping for a yes or a no?

170
00: 20: 41,400 -> 00: 20: 44,380
I have to make sure
that Phillips is not going bankrupt.

171
00: 20: 44,680 -> 00: 20: 50,060
You don't care about Phillips.
You just want to impress your bosses.

172
00: 20: 50,359 -> 00: 20: 53,659
Get a long-term contract
at the head office.

173
00: 20: 53,960 -> 00: 20: 58,360
You're just a zero
with lots of student debt.

174
00: 21: 03,519 -> 00: 21: 10,099
Ed, Jonathan. I can't stay long.
I'm leaving tonight and have a lot to fix.

175
00: 21: 10,400 -> 00: 21: 14,220
Shell withdraws from Norway.
We don't need the rig.

176
00: 21: 14,519 -> 00: 21: 19,099
We are not going to drill on 6/10.
Sorry. Thank you for your interest.

177
00: 21: 19,400 -> 00: 21: 23,280
It was a generous offer.
Good luck.

178
00: 21: 25,759 -> 00: 21: 29,859
- Two whiskeys. We have to toast for 2/4.
-No, Ed. The instructions are:

179
00: 21: 30,160 -> 00: 21: 36,960
If Shell does not want, then pay out Odeco, quit
short-term contracts, put the rig in circulation.

180
00: 21: 38,680 -> 00: 21: 41,360
You're a jerk.

181
00: 21: 51,400 -> 00: 21: 54,720
Mr. Carson, please.
Ed Young.

182
00: 21: 56,519 -> 00: 22: 00,119
Hi, Mr. Carson. Yes, sir.

183
00: 21: 59,880 -> 00: 22: 04,780
I know, but ...
Hear what I have to say ...

184
00: 22: 05,779 -> 00: 22: 10,619
I <i> know </i> that there is oil below 2/4.
One last well!

185
00: 22: 10,920 -> 00: 22: 17,340
How expensive can it be when everything is there?
Shell does not want Ocean Viking!

186
00: 22: 17,640 -> 00: 22: 22,000
What will be the price
if we don't? Hello?

187
00: 22: 27,000 -> 00: 22: 29,880
What do you think, Jonathan?

188
00: 22: 33,319 -> 00: 22: 35,519
I think -

189
00: 22: 35,640 -> 00: 22: 39,980
- to take the rolls
  with seismic surveys, -

190
00: 22: 40,279 -> 00: 22: 44,879
- Take the 19 plane to London
  and the 23 plane to Washington -

191
00: 22: 44,640 -> 00: 22: 51,880
- so the geologists can finger-scan
  the data tomorrow afternoon ...

192
00: 22: 52,759 -> 00: 22: 58,559
Then hopefully they can
make the right decision.

193
00: 23: 03,799 -> 00: 23: 07,000
Why did you change your mind?

194
00: 23: 07,119 -> 00: 23: 11,279
Only one dust says no
for a treasure hunt.

195
00: 23: 12,400 -> 00: 23: 14,960
Cheers for 2/4!

196
00: 23: 36,640 -> 00: 23: 38,440
You me ...

197
00: 23: 46,240 -> 00: 23: 50,400
-Are you going to travel?
-Yes. I'm sorry.

198
00: 24: 19,720 -> 00: 24: 23,660
-How did it go?
- He's gone.

199
00: 24: 23,960 -> 00: 24: 28,140
There is no oil here. Shell has
closed the exploration office, everyone is leaving.

200
00: 24: 28,440 -> 00: 24: 33,340
-It's not good enough.
- He wanted to give me money. Dad ...

201
00: 24: 33,640 -> 00: 24: 37,460
- I've been so stupid!
-It will be alright.

202
00: 24: 37,759 -> 00: 24: 42,099
I'm 17 years old, should have a youngster
and is all alone.

203
00: 24: 42,400 -> 00: 24: 46,360
You're never alone, my girl.
Never alone.

204
00: 24: 50,559 -> 00: 24: 54,940
Forgive me for everything
I have taken care of.

205
00: 24: 55,240 -> 00: 24: 59,660
I couldn't control,
and now I regret terribly.

206
00: 24: 59,960 -> 00: 25: 04,420
Dear God. Help my parents
so they must not suffer for my sake -

207
00: 25: 04,720 -> 00: 25: 09,480
- and the child to come and ...
  Help ... Amen.

208
00: 26: 54,640 -> 00: 26: 57,060
Enter Rettedal's office.
Minutes.

209
00: 26: 57,359 -> 00: 27: 02,959
Ed Young and Jonathan Kay
from Phillips. And the mayor.

210
00: 27: 03,440 -> 00: 27: 07,039
- It's going to be really high tempo.
-I'm fast.

211
00: 27: 17,680 -> 00: 27: 21,820
We have decided
to drill the last well.

212
00: 27: 22,119 -> 00: 27: 25,739
Good news. Now you can
get a place in the history books.

213
00: 27: 26,039 -> 00: 27: 29,980
Like the company that lost
the most money on the NCS!

214
00: 27: 30,279 -> 00: 27: 33,940
-What can we do for you?
-Two things.

215
00: 27: 34,240 -> 00: 27: 39,579
Make sure we can pull out
in a straightforward way when the time comes.

216
00: 27: 39,880 -> 00: 27: 42,620
Nothing in small print.

217
00: 27: 42,920 -> 00: 27: 48,500
We will do our best and hope
there is no need for it. And then?

218
00: 27: 48,799 -> 00: 27: 55,559
If we find something, we hope
that our investments have paid off -

219
00: 27: 55,359 -> 00: 27: 59,740
- by getting a more exclusive deal
  in the 2nd licensing round.

220
00: 28: 00,039 -> 00: 28: 05,379
I thought you had given it up.
You will never become a sole operator in Norway.

221
00: 28: 05,680 -> 00: 28: 08,220
Denmark has only one operator.

222
00: 28: 08,519 -> 00: 28: 13,500
Yes, but Denmark
has acted very stupid.

223
00: 28: 13,799 -> 00: 28: 19,659
They call themselves a social democracy, and so on
they have given everything to one family. Disgraceful.

224
00: 28: 19,960 -> 00: 28: 26,000
We just ask that you put
presented our view to the Oil Office.

225
00: 28: 26,799 -> 00: 28: 32,619
At least ask them to consider giving us
the first choice if we find oil for them.

226
00: 28: 32,920 -> 00: 28: 36,539
You must understand
how expensive this is for us.

227
00: 28: 36,839 -> 00: 28: 40,980
We understand that it is
both expensive and risky.

228
00: 28: 41,279 -> 00: 28: 45,779
You have worked well together
with the Norwegian companies.

229
00: 28: 46,779 -> 00: 28: 50,939
But what you've really done,
is to pack some agricultural land.

230
00: 28: 51,240 -> 00: 28: 57,460
For Shell, Esso, Gulf and Fina
the soil proved to be infertile.

231
00: 28: 57,759 -> 00: 29: 03,140
You still have the opportunity
to harvest something. Then you get your share.

232
00: 29: 03,440 -> 00: 29: 06,360
Good luck, gentlemen.

233
00: 29: 14,000 -> 00: 29: 16,599
Ed ... Always nice.

234
00: 29: 17,279 -> 00: 29: 19,000
Jonathan ...

235
00: 29: 22,039 -> 00: 29: 25,980
-Americans ...
- We should be glad they are here.

236
00: 29: 26,279 -> 00: 29: 32,899
Get a summary during the day.
What is said here remains here.

237
00: 29: 33,200 -> 00: 29: 36,360
-I agree with that.
-Thanks.

238
00: 29: 37,519 -> 00: 29: 39,339
Damn socialists!

239
00: 29: 39,640 -> 00: 29: 45,100
The United States is the only country in the world
where private owners own natural resources.

240
00: 29: 45,400 -> 00: 29: 49,220
Exactly. And who serves
most money on their oil?

241
00: 29: 49,519 -> 00: 29: 52,160
Gulf states.

242
00: 29: 54,480 -> 00: 29: 56,559
Thanks.

243
00: 29: 59,240 -> 00: 30: 01,759
Jonathan!

244
00: 30: 04,880 -> 00: 30: 10,540
Now there is one well left.
Our last chance before all hope is out.

245
00: 30: 10,839 -> 00: 30: 15,439
If it is empty, pulls too
the last company out.

246
00: 30: 15,200 -> 00: 30: 19,100
The shipyards are in crisis,
canning industry as well.

247
00: 30: 19,400 -> 00: 30: 22,740
Restaurants and hotels
has barely enough coating.

248
00: 30: 23,039 -> 00: 30: 27,339
The North Sea is empty of fish.
Unemployment is at a record high.

249
00: 30: 27,640 -> 00: 30: 31,460
No trawlers are being built,
no plots are sold.

250
00: 30: 31,759 -> 00: 30: 38,039
Without new industry Rogaland does not
no more legs to stand on.

251
00: 30: 40,799 -> 00: 30: 44,299
I was wet with sweat!
They talked so fast!

252
00: 30: 44,599 -> 00: 30: 49,419
Especially he the boss from Phillips.
I am not used to American.

253
00: 30: 49,720 -> 00: 30: 53,519
They said they came
to withdraw?

254
00: 30: 58,119 -> 00: 31: 01,699
Christian! We have to go out again.
Jackson called.

255
00: 31: 02,000 -> 00: 31: 06,980
They drill the last well.
The gang sits down at the motel.

256
00: 31: 07,279 -> 00: 31: 09720
We have to go down and have a beer!

257
00: 31: 16,400 -> 00: 31: 22,000
So there I am, at 30m deep,
and then I know it.

258
00: 31: 21,759 -> 00: 31: 27,460
The whiskey, the breakfast ...
Everything comes up again and into the valve.

259
00: 31: 27,759 -> 00: 31: 34,000
It's expensive beer!
It's from the States!

260
00: 31: 36,279 -> 00: 31: 39,460
-May I have another one?
-What?

261
00: 31: 39,759 -> 00: 31: 42,319
-Please?
- There, yes!

262
00: 31: 44,599 -> 00: 31: 48,699
Can't we take this later?
-No! Then she would have been rude.

263
00: 31: 49,000 -> 00: 31: 53,559
When the whole congregation is here,
she must behave.

264
00: 31: 54,680 -> 00: 31: 58,060
Toril?
You have to say goodbye to Bengt.

265
00: 31: 58,359 -> 00: 32: 00,279
Oh yes, yes ...

266
00: 32: 04,559 -> 00: 32: 06,779
Bengt has been a mate since last time.

267
00: 32: 07,779 -> 00: 32: 09,779
Oh?

268
00: 32: 10,960 -> 00: 32: 15,120
Maybe you can bring fish
back to Nyman, then.

269
00: 32: 25,960 -> 00: 32: 28,079
Christian, then!

270
00: 32: 38,359 -> 00: 32: 42,619
I must go out again soon
and stay awake for four months.

271
00: 32: 42,920 -> 00: 32: 46,740
If we can get that formal
in place before I leave.

272
00: 32: 47,039 -> 00: 32: 49,200
What?

273
00: 32: 52,160 -> 00: 32: 56,200
He has said yes
to marry you.

274
00: 32: 59,400 -> 00: 33: 05,400
He has agreed to lie down
act like the child's father.

275
00: 33: 09,519 -> 00: 33: 11,519
Toril?

276
00: 33: 12,640 -> 00: 33: 16,640
- Maybe you want to ...
- Talk to Bengt a bit.

277
00: 33: 18,519 -> 00: 33: 22,799
- Sit down and talk to Bengt.
-No no!

278
00: 33: 35,599 -> 00: 33: 38,139
Toril! Wait!

279
00: 33: 38,440 -> 00: 33: 41,920
We have to talk about this! Toril!

280
00: 34: 04,319 -> 00: 34: 07,259
Dad! Dad!

281
00: 34: 07,559 -> 00: 34: 11,179
-Be careful!
- You killed him!

282
00: 34: 11,480 -> 00: 34: 14,460
He ran into the road. Calm down.

283
00: 34: 14,760 -> 00: 34: 16,940
Calm down!

284
00: 34: 17,239 -> 00: 34: 19,439
He usually breathes.

285
00: 34: 19,559 -> 00: 34: 22,420
He has a pulse.
Call for an ambulance!

286
00: 34: 22,719 -> 00: 34: 27,319
Look at me.
We have to get him in stable side position.

287
00: 34: 27,779 -> 00: 34: 32,840
Take your hands on the side of your head.
Follow the movements of the body. Clear?

288
00: 34: 37,199 -> 00: 34: 40,679
What are you doing?

289
00: 34: 41,199 -> 00: 34: 44,659
We called an ambulance.
He has to go to hospital.

290
00: 34: 44,960 -> 00: 34: 47,780
You smell beer!
Have you been drinking?

291
00: 34: 48,779 -> 00: 34: 52,860
No. I ran a friend at a party.
He spilled beer on me.

292
00: 34: 53,159 -> 00: 34: 57,399
- Is anyone calling the ambulance?
- It's on its way.

293
00: 35: 25,480 -> 00: 35: 28,360
-Hi.
- There you are.

294
00: 35: 29,519 -> 00: 35: 31,940
-Is everything alright?
-Yes ...

295
00: 35: 32,239 -> 00: 35: 35,739
Come and sit down and get some food.

296
00: 35: 36,039 -> 00: 35: 38,039
I'll take that!

297
00: 35: 43,000 -> 00: 35: 45,139
Nyman, please ...

298
00: 35: 45,440 -> 00: 35: 48,300
Yes ...
Yes that's him.

299
00: 35: 48,599 -> 00: 35: 51,900
Don't you sit down?

300
00: 35: 52,199 -> 00: 35: 57,000
Of course.
We can get in early tomorrow.

301
00: 35: 59,599 -> 00: 36: 01,880
Whether he has been drinking?

302
00: 36: 05,779 -> 00: 36: 07,360
Who are you talking to?

303
00: 36: 12,360 -> 00: 36: 16,559
We have wine for the food. Oh well.

304
00: 36: 18,719 -> 00: 36: 21,799
Fine, see you soon. Thanks.

305
00: 36: 25,960 -> 00: 36: 29,380
You've run down a man!
In drunken state!

306
00: 36: 29,679 -> 00: 36: 31,859
I haven't been drinking!

307
00: 36: 32,159 -> 00: 36: 35,099
Okay, one beer.
Half and a half at most.

308
00: 36: 35,400 -> 00: 36: 39,220
He just ran right out of the way!
At the prayer house.

309
00: 36: 39,519 -> 00: 36: 41,900
Is he doing well?

310
00: 36: 42,199 -> 00: 36: 44,579
Yes I think so.

311
00: 36: 44,880 -> 00: 36: 48,700
Anna, look at the coffee.
Take a cold shower. The police are coming.

312
00: 36: 49,000 -> 00: 36: 51,940
-How much did you drink?
-Bottles or pint?

313
00: 36: 52,239 -> 00: 36: 54,559
-How much?
-Five.

314
00: 36: 54,360 -> 00: 36: 57,039
Should he lie to the police?

315
00: 36: 58,280 -> 00: 37: 01,500
Do you want him to go to jail?

316
00: 37: 01,800 -> 00: 37: 06,300
You don't want to ruin it
their whole future?

317
00: 37: 06,599 -> 00: 37: 09,239
Go in the shower.

318
00: 37: 28,920 -> 00: 37: 31,139
-I'm fine.
-Sure?

319
00: 37: 31,440 -> 00: 37: 35,579
- Get Toril. She's safe.
- She almost deserves it.

320
00: 37: 35,880 -> 00: 37: 38,320
It went well.

321
00: 37: 42,559 -> 00: 37: 48,159
He's been lucky.
Rib fractures and concussions.

322
00: 37: 53,760 -> 00: 37: 56,800
-Why did you run?
-I do not know.

323
00: 37: 59,280 -> 00: 38: 04,600
Next time
you breathe deeply and count to ten.

324
00: 38: 06,280 -> 00: 38: 11,000
Take care of Dad now.
No upsetting talk.

325
00: 38: 24,800 -> 00: 38: 28,000
Pardon.
I shouldn't have jumped.

326
00: 38: 29,039 -> 00: 38: 33,119
I am
that should not have jumped.

327
00: 38: 36,920 -> 00: 38: 40,579
- Don't marry that man.
- But mother, then?

328
00: 38: 40,880 -> 00: 38: 44,140
I'll talk to her.

329
00: 38: 44,440 -> 00: 38: 47,539
- She's ashamed.
-She is afraid.

330
00: 38: 47,840 -> 00: 38: 50,180
I'm scared too.

331
00: 38: 50,480 -> 00: 38: 53,599
What are you afraid of, then?

332
00: 38: 55,159 -> 00: 38: 59,379
That I will lie down
in the same bed as Bengt Hamre.

333
00: 38: 59,679 -> 00: 39: 02,919
Every day, the rest of my life.

334
00: 39: 03,559 -> 00: 39: 05,559
It will be alright.

335
00: 39: 06,400 -> 00: 39: 08,599
We find a solution.

336
00: 39: 26,920 -> 00: 39: 29,639
- Mrs. Nyman ...
-Thank you.

337
00: 39: 35,199 -> 00: 39: 38,439
Fredrik?
Are you calling for a taxi?

338
00: 39: 42,320 -> 00: 39: 45,600
Like that!
Christian is going on a sick visit.

339
00: 39: 50,440 -> 00: 39: 54,480
Anna, come on.
I'll show you something.

340
00: 40: 11,760 -> 00: 40: 14,620
- Oh, is that you?
- How's he doing?

341
00: 40: 14,920 -> 00: 40: 17,440
It goes well.

342
00: 40: 18,920 -> 00: 40: 20,700
I've been so scared.

343
00: 40: 21,000 -> 00: 40: 26,320
It wasn't your fault.
He ran to look for me.

344
00: 40: 29,559 -> 00: 40: 33,820
God really has
looked after us this time.

345
00: 40: 34,119 -> 00: 40: 36,679
Yes ... He probably has.

346
00: 40: 37,679 -> 00: 40: 40,639
- These are for Marius.
-Come.

347
00: 40: 42,559 -> 00: 40: 44,960
Dad? Visit to you.

348
00: 40: 50,719 -> 00: 40: 54,500
-Dad?
-I can come another day.

349
00: 40: 54,800 -> 00: 40: 59,700
No wait. He will be so happy.
He looks up to your family like that.

350
00: 41: 00,000 -> 00: 41: 05,360
Dad? Christian Nyman is here.
With flowers from Nyman.

351
00: 41: 05,760 -> 00: 41: 08,120
Dad?

352
00: 41: 09,320 -> 00: 41: 11,400
Dad?

353
00: 41: 13,960 -> 00: 41: 15,960
Dad!

354
00: 41: 58,000 -> 00: 42: 00,980
Then I ask you, Toril Torstensen.

355
00: 42: 01,280 -> 00: 42: 06,880
Do you want Bengt Hamre
to your spouse?

356
00: 42: 09,239 -> 00: 42: 11,279
Yes.

357
00: 42: 12,440 -> 00: 42: 18,340
Want to love and honor him, live with him
both adversity and hardship -

358
00: 42: 18,639 -> 00: 42: 23,099
- with the happiness of Almighty God
  will bestow upon you, -

359
00: 42: 23,400 -> 00: 42: 29,740
- that a real wife should live with
  Husband, until death do you divorce?

360
00: 42: 30,039 -> 00: 42: 32,519
Yes.
