00: 01: 22,560 -> 00: 01: 28,440
Our next guest is a free climbing phenomenon.
Welcome Alex Honnold!

4
00: 01: 30,880 -> 00: 01: 33,380
I don't get it.

5
00: 01: 33,680 -> 00: 01: 40,220
Do you make one single mistake, one small miss,
then you fall down and get killed.

6
00: 01: 40,520 -> 00: 01: 43,080
Then you've got it.

7
00: 01: 46,440 -> 00: 01: 51,060
I know you can die at any time.

8
00: 01: 51,360 -> 00: 01: 55,680
Free climbing does it more
immediately present.

9
00: 01: 58,000 -> 00: 02: 02,260
Gives it a different feel
when climbing without ropes?

10
00: 02: 02,560 -> 00: 02: 07,140
Without ropes, the consequences are greater.
The focus is much more intense.

11
00: 02: 07,440 -> 00: 02: 10,760
It's a completely different experience.

12
00: 02: 12,200 -> 00: 02: 16,300
I don't stretch the boundaries
until an accident happens.

13
00: 02: 16,600 -> 00: 02: 19,200
Not as I see it.

14
00: 02: 20,720 -> 00: 02: 24,420
Maybe it is
the biggest risk to me.

15
00: 02: 24,720 -> 00: 02: 28,400
I don't know when I'm on the edge.

16
00: 02: 57,680 -> 00: 03: 01,620
I distinguish between risks
and consistency during climbing.

17
00: 03: 01,920 -> 00: 03: 06,860
Because the risk of falling is small,
but the consequences are great.

18
00: 03: 07,160 -> 00: 03: 12,660
Some of the point of free climbing is
to do a dangerous thing safely.

19
00: 03: 12,960 -> 00: 03: 19,220
Do you think the clearance has been positive
or negative to your love life?

20
00: 03: 19,520 -> 00: 03: 21,420
My love life?

21
00: 03: 21,720 -> 00: 03: 27,520
It has been largely negative.
There is a lot of traveling. I live in the car.

22
00: 03: 34,480 -> 00: 03: 38,080
Let's talk about your climbing adventures.

23
00: 03: 37,840 -> 00: 03: 40,940
You wrote history on Moonlight Buttress.

24
00: 03: 41,240 -> 00: 03: 45,620
When I did,
it seemed radical and groundbreaking.

25
00: 03: 45,920 -> 00: 03: 50,020
But to me it felt
quite light and safe.

26
00: 03: 50,320 -> 00: 03: 55,580
But that was not all.
Afterwards, you cleared the Half Dome alone.

27
00: 03: 55,880 -> 00: 04: 01,520
The Half Dome was something new. Twice as loud
like anything else I had climbed before.

28
00: 04: 02,320 -> 00: 04: 07,980
Solo free climbing is so dangerous just
one in a hundred climbers tries it.

29
00: 04: 08,280 -> 00: 04: 14,320
Alex has climbed over a thousand different walls,
but this is the toughest one so far.

30
00: 04: 15,600 -> 00: 04: 21,400
I got pretty scared in some places.
Panicked a bit. Then you have to rewind.

31
00: 04: 24,480 -> 00: 04: 27,420
What will be the next challenge?

32
00: 04: 27,720 -> 00: 04: 31,620
I've been thinking about El Capitan for many years.

33
00: 04: 31,920 -> 00: 04: 38,000
It's really scary. I have
want to do it, but it's scary.

34
00: 04: 43,400 -> 00: 04: 47,080
I'm on my way to
the world's most beautiful valley.

35
00: 04: 48,320 -> 00: 04: 54,740
I remember we went here when I was a kid.
Dad brought milk and biscuits.

36
00: 04: 55,040 -> 00: 05: 00,320
We sat on the rocks at Tunnel View,
the best view in Yosemite.

37
00: 05: 00,920 -> 00: 05: 05,520
It's always just as exciting
when El Capitan comes into view.

38
00: 05: 08,080 -> 00: 05: 13,320
El Capitan is the most impressive
vertical mountain wall in the world.

39
00: 05: 39,520 -> 00: 05: 43,680
Spring 2016.

40
00: 05: 54,720 -> 00: 05: 57,460
I like living in the habit.

41
00: 05: 57,760 -> 00: 06: 03,420
After nine years it has probably become extra
homely. The first habit ...

42
00: 06: 03,720 -> 00: 06: 09,180
I stole the family minivan. Dad died
when I was 19 years old. I quit school.

43
00: 06: 09,480 -> 00: 06: 15,220
I just got the money from
his life insurance. Six years ago -

44
00: 06: 15,520 -> 00: 06: 21,180
- I was staying in a parking lot.
 My dinner budget was 88 cents.

45
00: 06: 21,480 -> 00: 06: 25,740
Living in the van is great,
but one misses a bath.

46
00: 06: 26,040 -> 00: 06: 28,400
The ability to shower.

47
00: 06: 35,000 -> 00: 06: 38,900
-Do you have a boyfriend now?
-It is getting closer.

48
00: 06: 39,200 -> 00: 06: 42,100
She supports me when it comes to ...

49
00: 06: 42,400 -> 00: 06: 46,220
So, I must be me. So yeah.

50
00: 06: 46,520 -> 00: 06: 50,180
But I always come to
to have other girlfriends -

51
00: 06: 50,480 -> 00: 06: 55,300
- in the form of new climbing challenges,
 new goals in life.

52
00: 06: 55,600 -> 00: 07: 01,320
I always want to choose the climb
in front of the girlfriend. At least for now.

53
00: 07: 04,120 -> 00: 07: 07,900
- Have you climbed it before?
- About 40 times.

54
00: 07: 08,200 -> 00: 07: 11,620
-Did you release it?
- No one has.

55
00: 07: 11,920 -> 00: 07: 17,520
- Why haven't you done it yet?
-Look at that. It's scary.

56
00: 07: 17,280 -> 00: 07: 22,480
I've been thinking about it since 2009.
"This year, I'll do it."

57
00: 07: 22,600 -> 00: 07: 27,800
But every time I try,
I realize that is impossible.

58
00: 07: 27,920 -> 00: 07: 34,020
But I won't give up until I know
that I have done my best.

59
00: 07: 34,320 -> 00: 07: 40,280
Then it may be up to new powers,
or someone who has nothing to live for.

60
00: 07: 50,400 -> 00: 07: 54,980
When I started thinking about El Capitan,
there was a lot of uncertainty.

61
00: 07: 55,280 -> 00: 08: 01,920
I was unsure of different stages and smooth
parties. Most of it seemed like madness.

62
00: 08: 03,040 -> 00: 08: 09,660
If the goal is to release El Capitan,
I have to chart what it means.

63
00: 08: 09,960 -> 00: 08: 16,240
Form me a picture of the toughest
the parties, where they are, what they require.

64
00: 08: 17,720 -> 00: 08: 23,320
If I should, it works
as if Freerider is the best route.

65
00: 08: 26,200 -> 00: 08: 28,680
-Hi!
-What's up?

66
00: 08: 32,400 -> 00: 08: 36,780
I attach it to the harness.
Should I go up Freeblast first?

67
00: 08: 37,080 -> 00: 08: 42,120
Tommy Caldwell, climber
We do like last. You go first.

68
00: 08: 42,760 -> 00: 08: 46,240
I'll try to go as far as I can.

69
00: 08: 51,520 -> 00: 08: 55,100
Now Tommy has arrived.
They have to climb Freerider.

70
00: 08: 55,400 -> 00: 09: 01,740
Jimmy Chin, filmmaker
I'm going to try to film this stage
and the traverse, I give myself.

71
00: 09: 02,040 -> 00: 09: 04,720
Do we have enough ropes for this?

72
00: 09: 15,320 -> 00: 09: 20,520
I want to climb El Capitan
with Tommy to get a picture of the route.

73
00: 09: 20,640 -> 00: 09: 24,000
What feels scary or okay.

74
00: 09: 25,480 -> 00: 09: 28,400
It's rope there from before.

75
00: 09: 31,800 -> 00: 09: 35,000
Tommy was my childhood hero.

76
00: 09: 35,120 -> 00: 09: 40,680
I didn't have posters of him,
but he was like my role model.

77
00: 09: 43,240 -> 00: 09: 47,840
Tommy proved
that you could climb on El Capitan.

78
00: 09: 47,600 -> 00: 09: 50,800
Tommy has explored all the possibilities.

79
00: 09: 50,920 -> 00: 09: 57,280
Most of his routes are so tough
that no one has climbed them after him.

80
00: 09: 58,080 -> 00: 10: 02,780
After several years of preparation
he released Dawn Wall.

81
00: 10: 03,080 -> 00: 10: 06,200
Perhaps the world's most difficult mountain wall.

82
00: 10: 16,600 -> 00: 10: 20,700
I've been obsessed
of El Capitan for many years.

83
00: 10: 21,000 -> 00: 10: 25,920
El Capitan is amazing.
It is incredibly huge.

84
00: 10: 26,800 -> 00: 10: 29,540
975 meters of vertical granite.

85
00: 10: 29,840 -> 00: 10: 33,680
It looks as if
it is impossible to climb it.

86
00: 10: 36,800 -> 00: 10: 41,980
I understand why Alex is obsessed
of it. Many climbers have been there.

87
00: 10: 42,280 -> 00: 10: 46,100
Warren Harding coped
to climb it in 1958.

88
00: 10: 46,400 -> 00: 10: 53,160
It took 46 days in 16 months.
They could not climb it in one go.

89
00: 10: 55,920 -> 00: 11: 00,700
They had to fix bolts in the granite
and haul himself up. Since then -

90
00: 11: 01,000 -> 00: 11: 06,360
- it has been a center
 for rock climbing.

91
00: 11: 08,920 -> 00: 11: 13,420
I've been climbing in El Capitan for 20 years,
but never without a rope.

92
00: 11: 13,720 -> 00: 11: 15,980
The margin of error is zero.

93
00: 11: 16,280 -> 00: 11: 21,820
Imagine a sporting achievement
at the Olympic level -

94
00: 11: 22,120 -> 00: 11: 26,020
- where second place is a sure death.

95
00: 11: 26,320 -> 00: 11: 32,120
This is how to climb El Capitan.
You have to do it perfectly.

96
00: 11: 36,800 -> 00: 11: 42,220
Today I explore many different things
options. Considering different features.

97
00: 11: 42,520 -> 00: 11: 47,820
How to position the body.
And how it would feel -

98
00: 11: 48,120 -> 00: 11: 50,720
- if I didn't have a rope.

99
00: 11: 52,600 -> 00: 11: 59,320
There is a lot you can do with rope
which one would not dry without rope.

100
00: 11: 59,920 -> 00: 12: 03,860
Oh my God. I have so much pain in my feet.
Are totally pumpkin.

101
00: 12: 04,160 -> 00: 12: 08,640
Pain in the hands too.
Tired of using your whole body.

102
00: 12: 10,880 -> 00: 12: 17,620
After thinking about something for many years,
it's time to discuss it with someone.

103
00: 12: 17,920 -> 00: 12: 21,540
Especially with someone like Tommy.

104
00: 12: 21,840 -> 00: 12: 27,500
When I reached the Endurance Corner and crossed
traverse, it became very scary.

105
00: 12: 27,800 -> 00: 12: 32,580
- That bit is very exposed.
-There's at least one gripe.

106
00: 12: 32,880 -> 00: 12: 39,500
At Freeblast there are several steps where one
only one footing away from the abyss.

107
00: 12: 39,800 -> 00: 12: 45,380
Solo climbing is very personal.
You never discuss solo projects.

108
00: 12: 45,680 -> 00: 12: 51,080
I've never said about solo climbing.
I don't want extra pressure.

109
00: 12: 52,640 -> 00: 12: 57,020
I have often been asked
whether I want to climb El Capitan.

110
00: 12: 57,320 -> 00: 13: 02,720
I've responded elusively, myself
whether I have been determined.

111
00: 13: 12,600 -> 00: 13: 18,260
I used to be picky about the food.
When I was 19 or 20 years old ...

112
00: 13: 18,560 -> 00: 13: 22,900
After that, I realized
that I had to eat vegetables.

113
00: 13: 23,200 -> 00: 13: 28,160
So I tried different vegetables
systematically, one afterone.

114
00: 13: 28,800 -> 00: 13: 32,880
It worked pretty well.
Now I'm omnivorous.

115
00: 13: 37,160 -> 00: 13: 42,760
I stopped eating meat
a few years ago for the sake of the environment.

116
00: 13: 42,520 -> 00: 13: 46,440
Later I became interested
in the ethical aspects.

117
00: 13: 50,680 -> 00: 13: 53,060
We'll see what it gets.

118
00: 13: 53,360 -> 00: 13: 58,880
Many would probably feel sorry for me
which eats chili beans and eggs.

119
00: 14: 02,320 -> 00: 14: 08,820
I did not like unfamiliar food when I was little.
Be afraid of insects. A real little boy.

120
00: 14: 09,120 -> 00: 14: 13,900
I was pretty shy as a kid.
A little dark at heart, I think.

121
00: 14: 14,200 -> 00: 14: 17,020
Maybe "melancholy" is the word.

122
00: 14: 17,320 -> 00: 14: 22,540
I remember being fond of
playing with Lego and playing computer games.

123
00: 14: 22,840 -> 00: 14: 26,740
I discovered climbing
and climbed a lot at the center.

124
00: 14: 27,040 -> 00: 14: 32,900
But I didn't have many hobbies
or interests. Wasn't cool at all.

125
00: 14: 33,200 -> 00: 14: 38,100
I grew up in Sacramento.
Went international line in high school.

126
00: 14: 38,400 -> 00: 14: 41,940
We were all intellectual youth.

127
00: 14: 42,240 -> 00: 14: 47,880
In a way, it was okay to be lonely.
The line was customized there.

128
00: 14: 48,760 -> 00: 14: 53,620
That's when I started to climb more.
Went for a walk, started camping.

129
00: 14: 53,920 -> 00: 14: 58,140
I dare not talk to others,
so I climbed alone.

130
00: 14: 58,440 -> 00: 15: 03,940
I climbed alone because I didn't
knew someone, would not talk to anyone.

131
00: 15: 04,240 -> 00: 15: 07,840
Gorgeous.
I've outdone myself.

132
00: 15: 10,240 -> 00: 15: 13,040
Extra strong chili does the trick.

133
00: 15: 19,440 -> 00: 15: 22,860
I loved climbing trees and houses.

134
00: 15: 23,160 -> 00: 15: 28,160
When I went to school here,
I climbed on the roof and managed.

135
00: 15: 29,480 -> 00: 15: 35,300
Talking in front of young people is tough.
I was terrified to speak in class.

136
00: 15: 35,600 -> 00: 15: 39,940
But you relax more
when you get used to it.

137
00: 15: 40,240 -> 00: 15: 41,860
A Question.

138
00: 15: 42,160 -> 00: 15: 46,420
How does it feel
having made the hobby a livelihood?

139
00: 15: 46,720 -> 00: 15: 52,020
I think it's great
to be able to live off what you love best.

140
00: 15: 52,320 -> 00: 15: 54,900
Okay to get paid for it.

141
00: 15: 55,200 -> 00: 15: 57,600
How much money do you have?

142
00: 16: 00,440 -> 00: 16: 03,820
I have maybe $ 40 in my wallet.

143
00: 16: 04,120 -> 00: 16: 08,740
So, I earn money.

144
00: 16: 09,040 -> 00: 16: 13,660
About that
a moderately successful dentist. Mr. K?

145
00: 16: 13,960 -> 00: 16: 17,460
Alex, can you say something about your foundation?

146
00: 16: 17,760 -> 00: 16: 21,100
The organization is four to five years old.

147
00: 16: 21,400 -> 00: 16: 25,520
This video clip
can give you an introduction.

148
00: 16: 26,600 -> 00: 16: 32,500
I have traveled extensively on climbing trips.
See how people live elsewhere.

149
00: 16: 32,800 -> 00: 16: 36,540
Hit people.
A billion people lack power.

150
00: 16: 36,840 -> 00: 16: 41,180
So I created the foundation
to help improve balance.

151
00: 16: 41,480 -> 00: 16: 46,260
I have given 1/3 of my income
to contribute to environmental measures, -

152
00: 16: 46,560 -> 00: 16: 53,480
- solar cells and the like like boats
 relieves poverty and is good for the environment.

153
00: 17: 08,600 -> 00: 17: 11,040
- Oh, hey.
-Hi!

154
00: 17: 14,920 -> 00: 17: 21,220
I met Sanni on a book tour in Seattle.
Since that time we have stayed together.

155
00: 17: 21,520 -> 00: 17: 26,940
I think this is our first date,
a little easy climbing outside Las Vegas.

156
00: 17: 27,240 -> 00: 17: 31,860
I pulled her up a steep route.
Knew she would be overwhelmed.

157
00: 17: 32,160 -> 00: 17: 36,780
- Is she a rock climber?
-Sanni climbs a little thin.

158
00: 17: 37,080 -> 00: 17: 41,980
She has just begun.
She is not exactly a climber yet.

159
00: 17: 42,280 -> 00: 17: 47,980
Do you see that heart shape right in front of us?
Freerider goes to the left of it.

160
00: 17: 48,280 -> 00: 17: 51,480
This is the whole valley. Here is the main road.

161
00: 17: 51,600 -> 00: 17: 55,720
The most important formations are
in this area.

162
00: 17: 58,640 -> 00: 18: 01,840
Maybe I should read it?

163
00: 18: 01,960 -> 00: 18: 08,380
Alex gave a lecture in Seattle last year.
I knew nothing about him before that.

164
00: 18: 08,680 -> 00: 18: 12,860
But you have the same shirt
on half the pictures.

165
00: 18: 13,160 -> 00: 18: 16,620
Well, I didn't have a wardrobe assistant.

166
00: 18: 16,920 -> 00: 18: 19,220
And when he signed the book,

167
00: 18: 19,520 -> 00: 18: 26,520
<i> Sanni McCandless </i>
- He got my phone number.
 A girlfriend challenged me to that.

168
00: 18: 27,880 -> 00: 18: 32,480
I thought he was cute.
He is also mercilessly honest.

169
00: 18: 32,240 -> 00: 18: 36,860
-I think I'm attractive.
-It's not stable.

170
00: 18: 37,160 -> 00: 18: 43,100
He is funny. He is strange.
Very strange. It makes him interesting.

171
00: 18: 43,400 -> 00: 18: 49,000
Should I pose on the tree?
It swings like just that. Do not mess about.

172
00: 18: 48,760 -> 00: 18: 50,700
Just for you.

173
00: 18: 51,000 -> 00: 18: 54,280
I'm waiting. Okay.

174
00: 18: 58,520 -> 00: 19: 03,340
If the mosquitoes are bothering you,
just start climbing.

175
00: 19: 03,640 -> 00: 19: 07,360
-I can wait.
- Okay, as you please.

176
00: 19: 10,560 -> 00: 19: 16,340
Having a girlfriend in the habit is great.
She is small and cute. Live up the place.

177
00: 19: 16,640 -> 00: 19: 23,120
Doesn't take up too much space.
She makes life better in every way.

178
00: 19: 24,720 -> 00: 19: 27,120
Can you tighten the rope, Alex?

179
00: 19: 29,720 -> 00: 19: 32,960
This is scary.

180
00: 19: 40,320 -> 00: 19: 45,020
I was going to fire Alex down the last one
leg. Followed him.

181
00: 19: 45,320 -> 00: 19: 50,420
The rope slipped through the waist.
Right through my hands. He fell down.

182
00: 19: 50,720 -> 00: 19: 55,500
It was my mistake. I did not follow
with the end of the rope.

183
00: 19: 55,800 -> 00: 19: 59,300
"My God. What have I done?"

184
00: 19: 59,600 -> 00: 20: 05,580
The radiograph showed no response but CT
showed compression fractures in two vertebrae.

185
00: 20: 05,880 -> 00: 20: 10,100
I wanted to
to look up to her.

186
00: 20: 10,400 -> 00: 20: 13,860
I said, "This goes beyond climbing."

187
00: 20: 14,160 -> 00: 20: 18,780
"Will it make your life better?"
 she asked. "Hardly."

188
00: 20: 19,080 -> 00: 20: 21,760
This can hurt a little.

189
00: 20: 23,560 -> 00: 20: 28,160
I thought he could get
in bag and sack.

190
00: 20: 27,920 -> 00: 20: 32,340
"I think you can have a girlfriend
 and still climb. "

191
00: 20: 32,640 -> 00: 20: 34,420
Breath out.

192
00: 20: 34,720 -> 00: 20: 37,700
Fortunately, the violations were not serious.

193
00: 20: 38,000 -> 00: 20: 43,660
They said I could climb
as long as it didn't hurt.

194
00: 20: 43,960 -> 00: 20: 46,660
But I was put out a little.

195
00: 20: 46,960 -> 00: 20: 52,180
I know people who have
fell far and survived, got lucky.

196
00: 20: 52,480 -> 00: 20: 55,940
Now I realize that things can go wrong.

197
00: 20: 56,240 -> 00: 21: 02,680
If I climb and fall 50 meters,
the body will be crushed when I land.

198
00: 21: 03,600 -> 00: 21: 07,680
Summer 2016.

199
00: 21: 08,800 -> 00: 21: 11,880
Taghia in Morocco.

200
00: 21: 19,880 -> 00: 21: 25,560
I first came here in 2012. Afterwards
I had my best Yosemite season.

201
00: 21: 38,640 -> 00: 21: 43,600
- What did you say, Alex?
- You're over halfway. The rope looks good.

202
00: 21: 46,080 -> 00: 21: 48,340
Yeah, pretty nice rock.

203
00: 21: 48,640 -> 00: 21: 54,260
I think it's good training
for El Capitan to climb here in Morocco.

204
00: 21: 54,560 -> 00: 22: 00,320
It makes him stronger and faster.
Makes him feel better.

205
00: 22: 06,800 -> 00: 22: 12,120
To float on the mountain as you can with Alex,
is addictive.

206
00: 22: 14,560 -> 00: 22: 19,400
His attitude at risk does
that one feels invincible.

207
00: 22: 23,320 -> 00: 22: 26,920
It is very satisfying.

208
00: 22: 28,240 -> 00: 22: 31,960
But it might not be that good for me.

209
00: 22: 34,040 -> 00: 22: 37,840
Climbing with Alex is a burden.

210
00: 22: 39,000 -> 00: 22: 41,700
Like drinking beer and smoking.

211
00: 22: 42,000 -> 00: 22: 46,400
Nothing I want to do,
but sometimes I allow myself.

212
00: 22: 55,720 -> 00: 22: 58,340
What have you written in the diary?

213
00: 22: 58,640 -> 00: 23: 04,820
"Mountain wall 7c +. Fall at critical point.
 Too tired. Must get in better shape. "

214
00: 23: 05,120 -> 00: 23: 09,340
Do you note other things?
"Then the world's largest juniper tree."

215
00: 23: 09,640 -> 00: 23: 14,300
-No, not in the climbing journal.
- "Miss my cup."

216
00: 23: 14,600 -> 00: 23: 17,960
- "And Mom."
-No.

217
00: 23: 31,680 -> 00: 23: 39,100
Jimmy Chin, filmmaker
Okay, Jim is following you down a bit.
Claire takes over at the foot of the ravine.

218
00: 23: 39,400 -> 00: 23: 42,100
We are going to film on the mountain wall.

219
00: 23: 42,400 -> 00: 23: 45,740
Go to the top
as soon as we have passed?

220
00: 23: 46,040 -> 00: 23: 52,980
Jimmy and I have been working together for ten years.
Ripped on climbing trips all over the world.

221
00: 23: 53,280 -> 00: 23: 57,600
So when we come to Yosemite,
we will be "excited tight".

222
00: 24: 01,120 -> 00: 24: 06,820
Jimmy has put together a team of professionals
climbers. They fit the job perfectly.

223
00: 24: 07,120 -> 00: 24: 12,240
So it's really cool.
I get to climb with my best friends.

224
00: 24: 16,520 -> 00: 24: 21,500
Mikey? We should have some here.
From here you can see the whole route.

225
00: 24: 21,800 -> 00: 24: 26,420
Should we have 100 meters here
and 120 meters there? Double up?

226
00: 24: 26,720 -> 00: 24: 32,560
I've known Alex since he started
to climb Yosemite in 2008 or 2009.

227
00: 24: 32,920 -> 00: 24: 37,100
I've filmed Alex climbing a few times.

228
00: 24: 37,400 -> 00: 24: 41,620
We have been to South America
a couple of times in the winter.

229
00: 24: 41,920 -> 00: 24: 46,020
<i> Mikey Schaefer, climber and photograph </i>
Pretty much all in all.

230
00: 24: 46,320 -> 00: 24: 51,940
I'm afraid something's going to happen to Alex.
I thanked almost no for the job.

231
00: 24: 52,240 -> 00: 24: 57,720
I think Jimmy was also wondering
whether we should participate or not.

232
00: 24: 59,360 -> 00: 25: 04,860
I have shared opinions about
filming free climbing. It's so dangerous.

233
00: 25: 05,160 -> 00: 25: 08,780
It's hard not to imagine it.

234
00: 25: 09,080 -> 00: 25: 13,180
He carries on dangerous free climbing
while filming.

235
00: 25: 13,480 -> 00: 25: 16,460
It puts extra pressure on him.

236
00: 25: 16,760 -> 00: 25: 20,280
He may fall to death while filming.

237
00: 25: 24,000 -> 00: 25: 29,540
That's something we have to work on.
We need to know that what we do,

238
00: 25: 29,840 -> 00: 25: 35,280
- is something we can live with
 even if the worst was to happen.

239
00: 25: 39,680 -> 00: 25: 45,580
The weird thing is that those who know a little about climbing,
think he has control, is completely safe.

240
00: 25: 45,880 -> 00: 25: 50,580
While those who know exactly what
he is doing, is terrified.

241
00: 25: 50,880 -> 00: 25: 54,780
Dad wouldn't
that I should do ice climbing.

242
00: 25: 55,080 -> 00: 25: 59,540
Not solo free climbing either.
When he was my age,

243
00: 25: 59,840 -> 00: 26: 02,780
- he had lost many friends.

244
00: 26: 03,080 -> 00: 26: 10,280
Well, I've come to a point where
30 or 40 of my friends have been killed.

245
00: 26: 10,400 -> 00: 26: 15,380
-Not close friends, but acquaintances in the environment.
- Like Kyle Dempster.

246
00: 26: 15,680 -> 00: 26: 21,760
I still haven't lost
some really close friends.

247
00: 26: 25,400 -> 00: 26: 31,760
But everyone who has done the free climbing
a main occupation, has been killed.

248
00: 26: 33,240 -> 00: 26: 36,580
John Bachar was a free climbing pioneer.

249
00: 26: 36,880 -> 00: 26: 40,620
He fell to death last week,
52 years old.

250
00: 26: 40,920 -> 00: 26: 45,620
It is with sadness we report
that climber Sean Leary is dead.

251
00: 26: 45,920 -> 00: 26: 48,620
Sean died in Utah, and was found ...

252
00: 26: 48,920 -> 00: 26: 53,740
Derek Hersey climbed in Yosemite.
The body was found Saturday morning.

253
00: 26: 54,040 -> 00: 26: 57,340
Hersey climbed alone and without ropes.

254
00: 26: 57,640 -> 00: 27: 02,460
Most who stretch the boundaries,
have the same setting:

255
00: 27: 02,760 -> 00: 27: 05,880
"Same thing. If it happens, then it happens."

256
00: 27: 26,880 -> 00: 27: 30,540
I think all the clearance
has sharpened him.

257
00: 27: 30,840 -> 00: 27: 35,700
He is not emotionally affected
of it to the same degree as others.

258
00: 27: 36,000 -> 00: 27: 39,500
I think maybe
it's more about learning -

259
00: 27: 39,800 -> 00: 27: 43,680
- than hereditary things.

260
00: 27: 45,480 -> 00: 27: 50,380
Many have wondered how
I deal with the fear when I climb.

261
00: 27: 50,680 -> 00: 27: 55,240
If there is something wrong with me
since I'm looking for excitement.

262
00: 27: 59,280 -> 00: 28: 02,620
One writer asked if I wanted to take an MRI.

263
00: 28: 02,920 -> 00: 28: 07,020
It could be cool to see what happens.

264
00: 28: 07,320 -> 00: 28: 11,520
Scan your brain and see if everything is in place.

265
00: 28: 12,920 -> 00: 28: 18,960
Let's start now. Push the button
every time a new image pops up.

266
00: 28: 22,800 -> 00: 28: 26,420
We'll see if I'm abnormal or something.

267
00: 28: 26,720 -> 00: 28: 32,360
Several of my boyfriends have said
that I have personality disorders.

268
00: 28: 33,200 -> 00: 28: 38,100
"Emotionally stable". "Agree".
"Thoughtful and inventive".

269
00: 28: 38,400 -> 00: 28: 42,900
"Disagree".
"Finding fault with others". "Partially agree".

270
00: 28: 43,200 -> 00: 28: 48,060
"The idea of ​​rock climbing scares me".
"Hard to control impulses".

271
00: 28: 48,360 -> 00: 28: 50,440
"Is depressed".

272
00: 28: 55,200 -> 00: 28: 58,620
- Is my brain intact?
- It's intact.

273
00: 28: 58,920 -> 00: 29: 04,660
It's pretty interesting. Those two
small dots in the upper half of the image -

274
00: 29: 04,960 -> 00: 29: 07,540
- represents the amygdala.

275
00: 29: 07,840 -> 00: 29: 13,340
The interesting thing is the fear center
not being activated at all.

276
00: 29: 13,640 -> 00: 29: 17,260
So it's going on
nothing special in my brain?

277
00: 29: 17,560 -> 00: 29: 21,260
-Do you think the amygdala doesn't work?
- It works.

278
00: 29: 21,560 -> 00: 29: 26,420
Jane E. Joseph, neurophysiologist
But it requires more stimuli than usual.

279
00: 29: 26,720 -> 00: 29: 32,580
Things that others experience
Stimulating, doesn't quite work for you.

280
00: 29: 32,880 -> 00: 29: 37,520
Maybe the amygdala is
tired of too much tension?

281
00: 29: 42,920 -> 00: 29: 46,800
Fall 2016.

282
00: 29: 53,640 -> 00: 29: 58,520
Step 6.

283
00: 30: 06,760 -> 00: 30: 12,020
I feel cranky but free-climbing
is also about the mental.

284
00: 30: 12,320 -> 00: 30: 16,180
The hardest thing is
to maintain control mentally.

285
00: 30: 16,480 -> 00: 30: 20,400
You don't control fear,
you steer away from it.

286
00: 30: 24,120 -> 00: 30: 26,800
Oh no! Sorry, Alex.

287
00: 30: 27,440 -> 00: 30: 32,340
They talk about suppressing fear.
That's not how I see it.

288
00: 30: 32,640 -> 00: 30: 37,140
I increase security by
to practice the steps over and over again.

289
00: 30: 37,440 -> 00: 30: 40,360
Jobs until the fear disappears.

290
00: 30: 43,320 -> 00: 30: 46,960
No no no! So happy!

291
00: 30: 48,080 -> 00: 30: 52,480
But I've been terrified
for Freeblast for many years.

292
00: 30: 53,960 -> 00: 31: 00,260
Minor irregularities are present,
small variations in the granite surface.

293
00: 31: 00,560 -> 00: 31: 07,200
The grip is not good enough to hold one
if you slip. Only two contact points.

294
00: 31: 08,200 -> 00: 31: 11,840
When you push off, you only have one.

295
00: 31: 24,040 -> 00: 31: 27,020
It looks much better today.

296
00: 31: 27,320 -> 00: 31: 29,640
But we'll see.

297
00: 31: 32,240 -> 00: 31: 37,900
I must have fallen almost 10 feet.
We were in a rope. Sandra secured me.

298
00: 31: 38,200 -> 00: 31: 43,060
Then I just fell off.
I don't even know how it happened.

299
00: 31: 43,360 -> 00: 31: 48,060
- Show me how much you can move it.
- It's like ...

300
00: 31: 48,360 -> 00: 31: 51,560
It seems like a sprain in the ankle.

301
00: 31: 51,680 -> 00: 31: 56,020
You could call it that
for sprains or tendons.

302
00: 31: 56,320 -> 00: 32: 01,220
What does it mean for walking and stuff?
Can I immobilize it?

303
00: 32: 01,520 -> 00: 32: 06,020
Yes, just take it easy the first few days.

304
00: 32: 06,320 -> 00: 32: 11,280
-Can physical activity make it worse?
-Don't start too soon.

305
00: 32: 20,880 -> 00: 32: 23,100
Wait. Not so tight.

306
00: 32: 23,400 -> 00: 32: 29,620
I'm worried, but know he's coming
to regret not doing so.

307
00: 32: 29,920 -> 00: 32: 34,540
If we were married, had children,
I would have been less careful -

308
00: 32: 34,840 -> 00: 32: 39,140
- by saying when I see
 the risk is unacceptable.

309
00: 32: 39,440 -> 00: 32: 42,400
He was going to put on his shoe!

310
00: 32: 45,960 -> 00: 32: 48,360
He is stubborn.

311
00: 32: 54,880 -> 00: 32: 59,140
- I thought you should be on your feet now.
-I am.

312
00: 32: 59,440 -> 00: 33: 03,180
- The doctor said you should work out.
- Can I get watermelon?

313
00: 33: 03,480 -> 00: 33: 09,020
- Well, fortunately, you have a slave to it.
-Yes, that's great.

314
00: 33: 09,320 -> 00: 33: 15,020
You have to ask why I cut it like that
no matter how I cut it?

315
00: 33: 15,320 -> 00: 33: 20,140
I want to blame Sanni.
Has been injury-free for seven years.

316
00: 33: 20,440 -> 00: 33: 26,020
Then I stay with a girl without
climbing experience, and the damage piles up.

317
00: 33: 26,320 -> 00: 33: 28,400
Pure trellises.

318
00: 33: 35,720 -> 00: 33: 40,460
They call it "active rehabilitation".
It does not mean -

319
00: 33: 40,760 -> 00: 33: 43,380
- that you have to go all the time.

320
00: 33: 43,680 -> 00: 33: 49,280
I would have been happier
if he did not escape alone.

321
00: 33: 49,040 -> 00: 33: 54,500
I'm glad he didn't
tells me about the climbs in advance.

322
00: 33: 54,800 -> 00: 34: 02,960
Dierdre Wolownick, Alex's mother
Then I had appeared and said that he
should not be. But this is life for him.

323
00: 34: 04,080 -> 00: 34: 09,580
I think he feels most alive
when he climbs. Feels most of all.

324
00: 34: 09,880 -> 00: 34: 11,700
Have the most emotions.

325
00: 34: 12,000 -> 00: 34: 17,040
It is unthinkable
to take something from a human being.

326
00: 34: 17,920 -> 00: 34: 20,920
Three weeks after the sprain.

327
00: 34: 27,520 -> 00: 34: 35,520
I can stand on one leg and put on my harness
and the shoes. It's a small step forward.

328
00: 34: 36,200 -> 00: 34: 41,720
I almost didn't wear the climbing shoes
since the accident. It's tender yet.

329
00: 34: 46,800 -> 00: 34: 52,400
Unfortunately, one is totally addicted
of the ankle when climbing in cracks.

330
00: 34: 52,160 -> 00: 34: 55,920
Freerider has 900 meters of cracks.

331
00: 34: 57,160 -> 00: 35: 03,440
Everyone I know who has sprained the ankle,
says it takes six months to recover.

332
00: 35: 05,880 -> 00: 35: 10,520
It's a month into the fall.
Then I have to delay it.

333
00: 35: 23,080 -> 00: 35: 29,380
A couple of years ago he said he did
had never experienced an unexpected fall.

334
00: 35: 29,680 -> 00: 35: 35,100
Now it has happened twice in one month.
But when you drive like that,

335
00: 35: 35,400 -> 00: 35: 37,500
- it's not so nice.

336
00: 35: 37,800 -> 00: 35: 44,000
The night before he called, I dreamed
that he came home to us. He cried.

337
00: 35: 44,120 -> 00: 35: 48,900
Then I was scared. He never cries.
He said he had fallen.

338
00: 35: 49,200 -> 00: 35: 53,740
Began to show me the damage.
Folded up the shirt sleeve.

339
00: 35: 54,040 -> 00: 35: 59,020
Then a phone fell out of his arm.
It was intense,

340
00: 35: 59,320 -> 00: 36: 05,360
- Absolutely absurd dream. The next day he called
 and said he had hurt himself.

341
00: 36: 06,680 -> 00: 36: 09,960
Hi! Ingrid?

342
00: 36: 10,680 -> 00: 36: 12,540
Hello.

343
00: 36: 12,840 -> 00: 36: 15,820
-Hi guys.
- Hi, Fitz!

344
00: 36: 16.120-> 00: 36: 20,120
Should you cut out a pumpkin?
Good!

345
00: 36: 22,560 -> 00: 36: 27,700
Alex refuses to participate in the pumpkin cutting.
He doesn't like party days.

346
00: 36: 28,000 -> 00: 36: 32,880
I'm not having fun
just because everyone is having fun.

347
00: 36: 36,600 -> 00: 36: 42,800
- She squeals. Don't let her go.
- Only if she stabs me in the eye.

348
00: 36: 42,920 -> 00: 36: 45,100
I'm just kidding.

349
00: 36: 45,400 -> 00: 36: 48,940
You need to lift her up more. Must ...

350
00: 36: 49,240 -> 00: 36: 53,060
-Now you should be scared.
-I have a lot of anxiety.

351
00: 36: 53,360 -> 00: 36: 57,460
No one in my family gave hugs
when I was growing up.

352
00: 36: 57,760 -> 00: 37: 01,740
I had to learn
to squeeze when I grew up.

353
00: 37: 02,040 -> 00: 37: 07,760
Everyone else hugged each other.
I had to practice. Now I'm pretty good.

354
00: 37: 08,720 -> 00: 37: 14,140
-Do you see that it represents a van?
-Is it a cat?

355
00: 37: 14,440 -> 00: 37: 16,420
I made it myself.

356
00: 37: 16,720 -> 00: 37: 20,060
It looks good now.
It was bad before.

357
00: 37: 20,360 -> 00: 37: 25,260
Some of the problem with the word,
by saying that you love someone, -

358
00: 37: 25,560 -> 00: 37: 31,200
- is that no one in my family
 ever used that word.

359
00: 37: 35,240 -> 00: 37: 41,220
Mom is a French teacher, so she talked
always French to my sister.

360
00: 37: 41,520 -> 00: 37: 44,500
Dad never talked about anything.

361
00: 37: 44,800 -> 00: 37: 51,680
Nobody was able to associate with Charlie.
He probably had asparagus.

362
00: 37: 54,600 -> 00: 37: 59,700
Charlie was obsessed with traveling.
It was just as important to him -

363
00: 38: 00,000 -> 00: 38: 06,140
- as climbing is for Alex. He was distraught
 when he wasn't on his way.

364
00: 38: 06,440 -> 00: 38: 11,140
When Alex did something stupid,
we called him a fool.

365
00: 38: 11,440 -> 00: 38: 13,420
Degrading things.

366
00: 38: 13,720 -> 00: 38: 19,880
If you get it imprinted in childhood,
I never think you will get over it.

367
00: 38: 21,520 -> 00: 38: 25,140
I don't remember it at all.

368
00: 38: 25,440 -> 00: 38: 32,040
I don't think Dad said anything bad about anyone.
He was like a teddy bear.

369
00: 38: 31,800 -> 00: 38: 34,180
But he was pretty hot.

370
00: 38: 34,480 -> 00: 38: 39,020
After the divorce
they both seemed much happier.

371
00: 38: 39,320 -> 00: 38: 46,020
But he died the following summer. It is
Too bad he didn't see how it went.

372
00: 38: 46,320 -> 00: 38: 50,120
Because he really supported me in the climb.

373
00: 38: 53,120 -> 00: 38: 58,260
But maybe Mother thought
that he held us again.

374
00: 38: 58,560 -> 00: 39: 03,460
Didn't inspire us
to realize our full potential.

375
00: 39: 03,760 -> 00: 39: 06,500
Mom's favorite phrase is:

376
00: 39: 06,800 -> 00: 39: 13,220
"Almost doesn't apply." "Good enough
 don't care. "No matter what I do,

377
00: 39: 13,520 -> 00: 39: 16,520
- it's not good enough.

378
00: 39: 19,920 -> 00: 39: 23,120
The bottomless gorge of self-contempt.

379
00: 39: 25,160 -> 00: 39: 29,720
Well, that's for sure
some of the motive for the free climb.

380
00: 39: 39,480 -> 00: 39: 42,320
Here it is.

381
00: 39: 42,800 -> 00: 39: 47,400
I still understand
not quite why you fell.

382
00: 39: 47,160 -> 00: 39: 49,260
Do you do that?

383
00: 39: 49,560 -> 00: 39: 54,260
Not completely. But my hands were rough.
It was raining and blowing.

384
00: 39: 54,560 -> 00: 40: 00,020
It is strange that he does not know how
it happened. Only that he suddenly fell.

385
00: 40: 00,320 -> 00: 40: 04,140
It surprises me.
Usually he is very conscious.

386
00: 40: 04,440 -> 00: 40: 07,720
Maybe he isn't anyway.

387
00: 40: 08,360 -> 00: 40: 11,620
He has a kind of armor when climbing.

388
00: 40: 11,920 -> 00: 40: 16,520
I think friends
and his family must have it too.

389
00: 40: 21,240 -> 00: 40: 26,180
But after that happened,
I have become more aware than before.

390
00: 40: 26,480 -> 00: 40: 31,320
Usually I think:
"He's absolutely raw. Is fine."

391
00: 40: 36,120 -> 00: 40: 39,920
But right now I'm really worried.

392
00: 40: 44,800 -> 00: 40: 51,280
So, I don't want to die.
But it is rewarding to challenge yourself.

393
00: 40: 53,600 -> 00: 41: 00,380
The feeling is even stronger when you know
that the slightest mistake can kill one.

394
00: 41: 00,680 -> 00: 41: 05,300
Solo free climbing is
the closest to perfection.

395
00: 41: 05,600 -> 00: 41: 10,880
And it feels good
to feel perfect for a moment.

396
00: 41: 14,680 -> 00: 41: 20,220
My friends say it had
been cruel if I was killed.

397
00: 41: 20,520 -> 00: 41: 22,420
But life goes on.

398
00: 41: 22,720 -> 00: 41: 27,700
The same goes for girlfriends.
They care about me, but not <i> so </i> much.

399
00: 41: 28,000 -> 00: 41: 33,840
If I'm killed, they'll find another one.
It is not the downfall of the world.

400
00: 41: 36,320 -> 00: 41: 38,300
Maybe a little insensitive.

401
00: 41: 38,600 -> 00: 41: 42,320
Five weeks after the sprain.

402
00: 41: 44,600 -> 00: 41: 48,800
My foot is better,
but still a bit swollen.

403
00: 41: 53,080 -> 00: 41: 55,160
Rope!

404
00: 42: 01,160 -> 00: 42: 03,460
Pretty sick rappelling.

405
00: 42: 03,760 -> 00: 42: 06,860
The wall has somehow become our commuter route.

406
00: 42: 07,160 -> 00: 42: 09,840
We just enjoy ourselves.

407
00: 42: 10,920 -> 00: 42: 16,420
Objectively speaking, there are six stages
at El Capitan that really worries me.

408
00: 42: 16,720 -> 00: 42: 19,180
The mountain is a little loose at the bottom.

409
00: 42: 19,480 -> 00: 42: 24,420
Then there is the sixth stage, Freeblast,
where I failed and fell.

410
00: 42: 24,720 -> 00: 42: 27,940
Then the descent to Hollow Flake.

411
00: 42: 28,240 -> 00: 42: 33,320
Then it's Monster Offwidth,
which is technically and physically demanding.

412
00: 42: 35,520 -> 00: 42: 37,860
Step 19.
487 meters.

413
00: 42: 38,160 -> 00: 42: 44,780
When in Monster Offwidth, you have
always at least one body part in a vice.

414
00: 42: 45,080 -> 00: 42: 48,180
It's like the world's worst pilot lesson.

415
00: 42: 48,480 -> 00: 42: 52,740
While being whipped
and rubbed with sandpaper -

416
00: 42: 53,040 -> 00: 42: 59,120
- while being told
 to hold the position or be killed.

417
00: 43: 03,760 -> 00: 43: 07,580
Enduro Corner alone would have been
the toughest stage -

418
00: 43: 07,880 -> 00: 43: 12,320
- on all other routes
 which I have cleared.

419
00: 43: 14,920 -> 00: 43: 17,740
The feet don't really have any attachment.

420
00: 43: 18,040 -> 00: 43: 22,360
It's just the pressure from the arms
that holds them in place.

421
00: 43: 24,080 -> 00: 43: 30,860
The harder you go, the better the attachment
the feet. The toughest stage for the arms.

422
00: 43: 31,160 -> 00: 43: 37,160
750 meters have already been climbed
to get there, so you are pretty tired.

423
00: 43: 38,640 -> 00: 43: 43,580
It is Crux that worries me the most.
That's the hardest bit.

424
00: 43: 43,880 -> 00: 43: 49,260
In order to get past one has to rush
Boulder Problem or Teflon Corner.

425
00: 43: 49,560 -> 00: 43: 54,960
600 meters above the ground. I've fallen
many times in both, but in ropes.

426
00: 43: 59,160 -> 00: 44: 03,980
Teflon Corner is a mirror gloss,
very smooth, perpendicular corner.

427
00: 44: 04,280 -> 00: 44: 07,260
It scares the water off me.

428
00: 44: 07,560 -> 00: 44: 13,140
Minor adjustments as I press my feet
and the hands against the mirror-stone, -

429
00: 44: 13,440 -> 00: 44: 16,940
- and try
 to distribute the weight evenly -

430
00: 44: 17,240 -> 00: 44: 23,240
- 760 meters up in a vertical rock wall.
 It's crazy to think about it.

431
00: 44: 25,560 -> 00: 44: 28,280
The alternative is the Boulder Problem.

432
00: 44: 30,200 -> 00: 44: 34,640
But it has an incredible
difficult stretch of three meters.

433
00: 44: 36,040 -> 00: 44: 40,660
It's a complicated sequence.
Pinch with your right hand.

434
00: 44: 40,960 -> 00: 44: 43,460
Left in a vertical furrow.

435
00: 44: 43,760 -> 00: 44: 47,020
Right foot on a small lump in the stone.

436
00: 44: 47,320 -> 00: 44: 52,920
Right hand over to a slight slant.
Left foot in a small recess.

437
00: 44: 53,640 -> 00: 44: 58,620
Slide off with left foot to
the worst grip on the whole route.

438
00: 44: 58,920 -> 00: 45: 01,760
Only half the thumb gets a grip.

439
00: 45: 02,520 -> 00: 45: 08,020
Then you turn two fingers over your thumb.
Change your feet.

440
00: 45: 08,320 -> 00: 45: 13,660
Stretches out the left foot
to a very small, oblique furrow.

441
00: 45: 13,960 -> 00: 45: 16,960
Switches grip to the other thumb.

442
00: 45: 19,080 -> 00: 45: 24,360
Then you stretch out your left hand
and grabs a slightly grainy, oblong shape.

443
00: 45: 26,920 -> 00: 45: 32,480
From there one must use karate kick or
both hands to skip.

444
00: 45: 34,320 -> 00: 45: 41,640
In a way, it's better to use your hands.
It's an edge you can get hold of.

445
00: 45: 47,520 -> 00: 45: 52,720
But it's crazy to do it without a rope.
If you fall, it's over.

446
00: 45: 55,880 -> 00: 46: 02,280
But the karate kick feels like
one falls against the wall. Also madness.

447
00: 46: 19,080 -> 00: 46: 23,660
To be honest it is known
okay when I got hold of it.

448
00: 46: 23,960 -> 00: 46: 29,180
-It didn't look stupid to use your foot.
- Didn't feel completely insane.

449
00: 46: 29,480 -> 00: 46: 31,880
But we'll see.

450
00: 46: 38,000 -> 00: 46: 42,180
-Have you taken ibuprofen today?
-I'll do it.

451
00: 46: 42,480 -> 00: 46: 45,200
Is it for the ankle?

452
00: 46: 46,560 -> 00: 46: 50,700
I'm not happy
for him to climb.

453
00: 46: 51,000 -> 00: 46: 54,220
He is an important part of my life.

454
00: 46: 54,520 -> 00: 46: 58,820
I often tell Alex
how happy I am in him.

455
00: 46: 59,120 -> 00: 47: 03,020
He shows how happy he is in me.

456
00: 47: 03,320 -> 00: 47: 07,260
But I tell him
that I need to hear it too.

457
00: 47: 07,560 -> 00: 47: 09,880
We are working on that.

458
00: 47: 11,560 -> 00: 47: 16,420
Alex has a lot to learn
about conveying emotions.

459
00: 47: 16,720 -> 00: 47: 19,920
"Sometimes when I say what I feel," -

460
00: 47: 20,040 -> 00: 47: 24,660
- "can you say you understand
 how i feel. "

461
00: 47: 24,960 -> 00: 47: 29,060
He prayedre ...
"I understand how you feel."

462
00: 47: 29,360 -> 00: 47: 34,480
I wasn't sure.
"But I appreciate the effort."

463
00: 47: 37,120 -> 00: 47: 41,940
-We work well together, Alex.
-Maybe not quite optimal yet.

464
00: 47: 42,240 -> 00: 47: 45,840
I think we are doing very well.

465
00: 47: 45,600 -> 00: 47: 50,180
I am glad that
that it works so well between them.

466
00: 47: 50,480 -> 00: 47: 53,320
I think it's impressive.

467
00: 47: 55,320 -> 00: 48: 00,920
But free-climbing at this level
requires some kind of mental armor.

468
00: 48: 00,680 -> 00: 48: 05,500
A couple relationship tears on
this armor, this focus.

469
00: 48: 05,800 -> 00: 48: 11,520
A close relationship removes the hood completely.
You can't get in a bag and bag.

470
00: 48: 39,080 -> 00: 48: 43,420
It takes something before you
feel safe on a route.

471
00: 48: 43,720 -> 00: 48: 47,340
It can be self-confidence
because you are in good shape.

472
00: 48: 47,640 -> 00: 48: 52,240
It can be preparation and rehearsal.

473
00: 48: 52,000 -> 00: 48: 56,160
Something concrete that does
that one feels ready.

474
00: 49: 02,240 -> 00: 49: 06,720
It helps to free other routes
to find the shape.

475
00: 49: 10,520 -> 00: 49: 16,060
- It's a little stressful.
-It's not possible.

476
00: 49: 16,360 -> 00: 49: 21,140
Although I trust Alex,
and knows how systematic he is -

477
00: 49: 21,440 -> 00: 49: 25,840
- it can quickly tip over
 when on the edge.

478
00: 49: 28,000 -> 00: 49: 30,500
Sometimes you have to tighten the boundaries.

479
00: 49: 30,800 -> 00: 49: 35,640
Because something is so raw.
El Capitan is so raw.

480
00: 49: 38,680 -> 00: 49: 42,180
Gradual development is taking place in all areas.

481
00: 49: 42,480 -> 00: 49: 45,680
Sometimes a paradigm shift occurs.

482
00: 49: 45,800 -> 00: 49: 50,660
If he manages to release El Capitan,
it is a quantum leap.

483
00: 49: 50,960 -> 00: 49: 58,640
Peter Croft, mountain climber
It's hard to imagine
that someone should be able to climb it without a rope.

484
00: 50: 01,320 -> 00: 50: 05,920
-Did you climb the routes often?
-Astroman three or four times.

485
00: 50: 05,680 -> 00: 50: 12,340
-But Rostrum, it must be 50-60 times.
-Did you get rid of Rostrum 50-60 times?

486
00: 50: 12,640 -> 00: 50: 16,840
I always climbed it
several times when I was here.

487
00: 50: 16,960 -> 00: 50: 21,560
Really close to the wall.
Not because I was scared, but ...

488
00: 50: 21,320 -> 00: 50: 26,660
-But because you got in such good shape.
- My footwork was fantastic.

489
00: 50: 26,960 -> 00: 50: 30,900
But I did
just for my own sake.

490
00: 50: 31,200 -> 00: 50: 37,540
After Astroman I got movie offers.
I was not interested in that at all.

491
00: 50: 37,840 -> 00: 50: 42,500
For me it was significant
that I did it for the right reason.

492
00: 50: 42,800 -> 00: 50: 49,220
I think I'm doing it for the right reason.
But for someone who sees it from the outside,

493
00: 50: 49,520 -> 00: 50: 52,740
- it may seem like the movie is the reason.

494
00: 50: 53,040 -> 00: 50: 59,300
The biggest danger of
to have a film team is that it can change -

495
00: 50: 59,600 -> 00: 51: 03,120
- the mental attitude.

496
00: 51: 08,680 -> 00: 51: 14,600
I think Alex is almost ready
to do it. He just has to practice a little.

497
00: 51: 16,080 -> 00: 51: 20,680
We're just trying to find out
where the cameras should be.

498
00: 51: 26,640 -> 00: 51: 31,840
The psyche is extremely vulnerable
when you climb.

499
00: 51: 31,960 -> 00: 51: 38,960
We want good footage without getting in the way
for him or for the experience he seeks.

500
00: 51: 43,800 -> 00: 51: 48,020
At worst, we can do something
that kill him.

501
00: 51: 48,320 -> 00: 51: 53,880
It could be a drone, a rope,
a stone that loosens accidentally.

502
00: 51: 58,160 -> 00: 52: 04,620
I try to avoid falling, but if so
happens when I'm alone, so be it.

503
00: 52: 04,920 -> 00: 52: 09,880
It is much worse
if my friends are experiencing the fall.

504
00: 52: 11,720 -> 00: 52: 16,100
The question is where
we can be without disturbing you.

505
00: 52: 16,400 -> 00: 52: 20,020
- As on stage 15.
- Traversers in there?

506
00: 52: 20,320 -> 00: 52: 25,260
And otherwise only have one camera
above Boulder Pitch.

507
00: 52: 25,560 -> 00: 52: 31,160
-Is it distracting?
- Not only that, but also ...

508
00: 52: 30,920 -> 00: 52: 34,000
No one wants to see it.

509
00: 52: 35,520 -> 00: 52: 37,700
Yes No ...

510
00: 52: 38,000 -> 00: 52: 42,680
It's better not to.
Some things are like ...

511
00: 52: 47,400 -> 00: 52: 51,840
-Greit.
- Should I go up and grind a little?

512
00: 52: 58,000 -> 00: 53: 02,300
The moon goes down at. 04.50.
The sunlight hits the sprout at. 07.30.

513
00: 53: 02,600 -> 00: 53: 05,700
The sunlight reaches Crux at. 5.8.

514
00: 53: 06,000 -> 00: 53: 11,460
You will avoid direct sun there. It is
three to four hours for the Boulder Problem.

515
00: 53: 11,760 -> 00: 53: 15,620
It is autumn.
One must begin before sunrise.

516
00: 53: 15,920 -> 00: 53: 20,200
I think I'm starting
to climb at four o'clock.

517
00: 53: 28,360 -> 00: 53: 31,880
So, now I'm starting to get gira.

518
00: 53: 34,840 -> 00: 53: 39,020
It is a relief when
one finally makes the decision.

519
00: 53: 39,320 -> 00: 53: 44,660
The stress, anxiety and fear are over.
Now it's just about doing it.

520
00: 53: 44,960 -> 00: 53: 50,060
I put on those tight shoes today.
Really exciting.

521
00: 53: 50,360 -> 00: 53: 56,460
It's like a samurai
finds out the favorite sword itself.

522
00: 53: 56,760 -> 00: 54: 01,180
"Time to get the gravel steel."
 So gira I am.

523
00: 54: 01,480 -> 00: 54: 06,880
I like joking with the Jedi thing.
The samurai with ...

524
00: 54: 07,520 -> 00: 54: 12,780
I have taken ibuprofen and used a lot of ice cream.
The foot is quite nice.

525
00: 54: 13,080 -> 00: 54: 16,580
What did Sanni say when you told her that?

526
00: 54: 16,880 -> 00: 54: 21,980
I haven't talked to her that much.
She has asked how things are going.

527
00: 54: 22,280 -> 00: 54: 25,220
I just said we'll see.

528
00: 54: 25,520 -> 00: 54: 29,380
It's really the best
that few know it.

529
00: 54: 29,680 -> 00: 54: 35,180
I dreamed you were buzzing.
You had fallen in exactly the same place.

530
00: 54: 35,480 -> 00: 54: 40,780
Damage the ankle in exactly the same way.
It was tragic.

531
00: 54: 41,080 -> 00: 54: 45,940
I woke up thinking:
"Oh, I hope it hasn't happened!"

532
00: 54: 46,240 -> 00: 54: 48,440
It was cute then.

533
00: 54: 48,560 -> 00: 54: 52,380
Take them with the day trips
up for you and Peter?

534
00: 54: 52,680 -> 00: 54: 56,480
No, for me tomorrow. Probably.

535
00: 54: 57,560 -> 00: 55: 01,380
-To wear the mountain?
- To have on top, yes.

536
00: 55: 01,680 -> 00: 55: 06,180
- Are you going to try the whole thing?
-Peter's coming in a couple of days.

537
00: 55: 06,480 -> 00: 55: 10,580
-Who are you going to climb tomorrow?
-We'll see.

538
00: 55: 10,880 -> 00: 55: 13,280
Oh well? Okay.

539
00: 55: 16,200 -> 00: 55: 21,420
Then you plan to release alone
tomorrow? But you don't want to say anything?

540
00: 55: 21,720 -> 00: 55: 24,700
-I say something, but yes.
-Oh, Alex.

541
00: 55: 25,000 -> 00: 55: 27,600
Oi, oi.

542
00: 55: 27,360 -> 00: 55: 31,900
- How does it feel?
- I'm really excited.

543
00: 55: 32,200 -> 00: 55: 36,900
-It's really exciting.
- So exciting that you read on.

544
00: 55: 37,200 -> 00: 55: 40,780
But you have to ...
No, I'm not reading now.

545
00: 55: 41,080 -> 00: 55: 46,800
-When did you decide to try tomorrow?
- Yesterday or yesterday.

546
00: 55: 48,600 -> 00: 55: 51,920
I have to let it sink in.

547
00: 56: 16,280 -> 00: 56: 20,480
I want something more than, "We're all going to die."

548
00: 56: 20,600 -> 00: 56: 24,260
"Let's do what we want while we're here."

549
00: 56: 24,560 -> 00: 56: 28,660
But I would like to
that you meet me halfway.

550
00: 56: 28,960 -> 00: 56: 35,300
That you include me in the calculation
when you climb. And that ...

551
00: 56: 35,600 -> 00: 56: 38,860
- Is this a question?
-It's coming.

552
00: 56: 39,160 -> 00: 56: 45,500
If you took me into account,
would it affect the choices you make?

553
00: 56: 45,800 -> 00: 56: 52,100
I couldn't have escaped if I was
committed to living as long as possible.

554
00: 56: 52,400 -> 00: 56: 56,980
Do you feel that there is a commitment
in what I ask for now?

555
00: 56: 57,280 -> 00: 56: 59,820
No.

556
00: 57: 00,120 -> 00: 57: 04,500
I appreciate and respect
that you care about me.

557
00: 57: 04,800 -> 00: 57: 11,380
- But I don't feel obligated.
-To live as long as possible?

558
00: 57: 11,680 -> 00: 57: 14,460
I don't know, but -

559
00: 57: 14,760 -> 00: 57: 20,500
- you want me to reduce the risk.
 I do as best I can.

560
00: 57: 20,800 -> 00: 57: 26,020
If I didn't do it,
wanted the most important thing in my life -

561
00: 57: 26,320 -> 00: 57: 29,960
- be overrun.
 You know what I mean?

562
00: 57: 45,640 -> 00: 57: 49,320
-What time is it?
-Half past three.

563
00: 57: 49,960 -> 00: 57: 55,580
- I woke up before the alarm clock rang.
- Did you wake up before or after?

564
00: 57: 55,880 -> 00: 57: 58,560
One minute before.

565
00: 58: 15,560 -> 00: 58: 19,240
It's about the ultimate, the perfect.

566
00: 58: 21,720 -> 00: 58: 26,040
I'm raised for it.
That one must deliver.

567
00: 58: 28,960 -> 00: 58: 34,000
But it is extreme
to do something like that for the first time.

568
00: 58: 48,640 -> 00: 58: 52,200
Hope gravity is weakening today.

569
00: 58: 54,240 -> 00: 58: 58,640
- Good, Huck. See you on the ground.
- We do.

570
00: 59: 06,520 -> 00: 59: 10,240
Step 6.
146 meters.

571
00: 59: 27,040 -> 00: 59: 29,240
This is too damn good.

572
00: 59: 30,040 -> 00: 59: 33,480
I don't want to be here.

573
00: 59: 35,800 -> 00: 59: 39,020
It holds for me.

574
00: 59: 39,320 -> 00: 59: 42,620
-What happened?
- I cheated on Freeblast Slab.

575
00: 59: 42,920 -> 00: 59: 47,120
-Can just like to report.
-Will you do it?

576
00: 59: 48,720 -> 00: 59: 54,700
Well, this is embarrassing. I don't know who
that fits the radio, but this is Alex.

577
00: 59: 55,000 -> 00: 59: 57,820
I think I'm giving up.

578
00: 59: 58,120 -> 00: 59: 59,940
Can you repeat that?

579
01: 00: 00,240 ->01: 00: 05.040
-I think he gives up on Heart Ledge. </ I>
- That's right. </ I>

580
01: 00: 08,640 -> 01: 00: 11,120
It's a little disturbing.

581
01: 00: 15,560 -> 01: 00: 18,100
Wonder what it was.

582
01: 00: 18,400 -> 01: 00: 22,780
I don't dare completely
to try while everyone is watching.

583
01: 00: 23,080 -> 01: 00: 26,840
I can not
to make a sincere attempt.

584
01: 00: 40,240 -> 01: 00: 43,060
-Oh my God!
-Good morning.

585
01: 00: 43,360 -> 01: 00: 46,820
I gave up.
It's too cool.

586
01: 00: 47,120 -> 01: 00: 49,960
Is it too cool? Oh well.

587
01: 00: 51,880 -> 01: 00: 54,100
What's up?

588
01: 00: 54,400 -> 01: 00: 56,200
Not much.

589
01: 00: 57,520 -> 01: 01: 02,100
-What is it?
-I came to Freeblast, so I gave up.

590
01: 01: 02,400 -> 01: 01: 05,020
-It is good.
- It felt weird.

591
01: 01: 05,320 -> 01: 01: 07,300
Yes.

592
01: 01: 07,600 -> 01: 01: 12,860
There were just too many others there.

593
01: 01: 13,160 -> 01: 01: 17,100
I came halfway through
the first smooth wall.

594
01: 01: 17,400 -> 01: 01: 21,500
- Then I became insecure.
- That was right for you.

595
01: 01: 21,800 -> 01: 01: 24,180
Now I'm just ...

596
01: 01: 24,480 -> 01: 01: 29,980
-Now there are just more delays.
-You don't have to do it.

597
01: 01: 30,280 -> 01: 01: 32,940
But I need to end it.

598
01: 01: 33,240 -> 01: 01: 37,600
The whole circus that is around it.

599
01: 01: 41,920 -> 01: 01: 46,160
I don't get it.
Wonder if he got nervous.

600
01: 01: 46,680 -> 01: 01: 49,080
Is it possible?

601
01: 01: 51,520 -> 01: 01: 56,060
There's a lot about him I don't quite understand.

602
01: 01: 56,360 -> 01: 02: 02,120
In a way, it's soothing
that Dr. Spock can get nervous.

603
01: 02: 12,680 -> 01: 02: 17,100
I never interrupted
a serious attempt before.

604
01: 02: 17,400 -> 01: 02: 22,180
It is also the first time
I seriously freak out with the audience.

605
01: 02: 22,480 -> 01: 02: 26,680
I might still have
if I was alone.

606
01: 02: 26,800 -> 01: 02: 32,400
Maybe I'm just not good enough.
But at least I have ...

607
01: 02: 33,480 -> 01: 02: 36,480
At least I've tried.

608
01: 02: 48,320 -> 01: 02: 51,280
Three months later.

609
01: 02: 56,560 -> 01: 03: 00,360
Thank you for meeting us again.

610
01: 03: 02,600 -> 01: 03: 08,800
It is strange. This place smells special.
Do you think it could be the paint?

611
01: 03: 10,360 -> 01: 03: 13,920
Dining room.
Probably with bookshelves.

612
01: 03: 14,600 -> 01: 03: 18,300
Okay, what's this?
"Approved by buyer"?

613
01: 03: 18,600 -> 01: 03: 22,480
Alex allows one question
about furniture per day.

614
01: 03: 23,440 -> 01: 03: 28,900
I've been thinking about buying a home,
but have not been able to do it alone.

615
01: 03: 29,200 -> 01: 03: 34,180
Sanni wants a place to stay.
There are good climbing opportunities in the area.

616
01: 03: 34,480 -> 01: 03: 37,780
A large sofa section here and a chair.

617
01: 03: 38,080 -> 01: 03: 41,400
Or a sofa and two chairs.

618
01: 03: 42,800 -> 01: 03: 46,400
Possible bar area.

619
01: 03: 47,080 -> 01: 03: 50,480
I would have slept on the floor.

620
01: 03: 58,200 -> 01: 04: 03,700
Alex was a jerk. While I did at all
with the tape measure, Alex stood ready -

621
01: 04: 04,000 -> 01: 04: 09,980
- to tell me I looked stupid.
 Not to help or support me.

622
01: 04: 10,280 -> 01: 04: 12,800
Now things have gone in the dough.

623
01: 04: 13,560 -> 01: 04: 19,140
- If you ask about the house peace, there is no one.
-You're angry, but you crack cracks.

624
01: 04: 19,440 -> 01: 04: 22,660
Oh no, you. I'm just as angry.

625
01: 04: 22,960 -> 01: 04: 27,420
I notice you cracking.
You do it.

626
01: 04: 27,720 -> 01: 04: 33,160
No, I don't crack cracks.
This is firm determination and hatred.

627
01: 04: 35,080 -> 01: 04: 37,600
Oh, help.

628
01: 04: 39,640 -> 01: 04: 42,520
It is very large and wide.

629
01: 04: 45,600 -> 01: 04: 49,360
Oh, it looks very deep.

630
01: 04: 50,080 -> 01: 04: 56,260
Okay, we'll find something less.
Here it is for $ 400. This is the thing.

631
01: 04: 56,560 -> 01: 05: 01,040
This is actually perfect.
It's just so adequate.

632
01: 05: 04,560 -> 01: 05: 06,880
-You have a fridge!
-Happiness!

633
01: 05: 11,280 -> 01: 05: 15,180
We had a bad period after Yosemite.

634
01: 05: 15,480 -> 01: 05: 20,700
Where ... Alex is not
so good at putting words on emotions.

635
01: 05: 21,000 -> 01: 05: 27,600
Like, "I'm grumpy. Don't know why.
Don't bother to mess with it. "

636
01: 05: 27,360 -> 01: 05: 30,960
I have patience,
but also self-respect.

637
01: 05: 30,720 -> 01: 05: 34,480
As soon as I show dissatisfaction,
he shuts me out.

638
01: 05: 37,720 -> 01: 05: 41,580
How to make coffee?
Need a filter.

639
01: 05: 41,880 -> 01: 05: 47,780
The relationship with Sanni is the healthiest
and the most stable relationship I have had.

640
01: 05: 48,080 -> 01: 05: 50,360
Oi. The only thing in the closet.

641
01: 05: 51,160 -> 01: 05: 56,700
At least the most talkative.
Even Sanni says I am flourishing.

642
01: 05: 57,000 -> 01: 06: 01,600
This looks scary.
First coffee and then water?

643
01: 06: 01,360 -> 01: 06: 06,960
Hello! Oh my! Whoa.

644
01: 06: 06,720 -> 01: 06: 10,900
Get homeowners coffee
and breakfast served every day?

645
01: 06: 11,200 -> 01: 06: 15,460
-I don't understand how it works.
- Really complicated.

646
01: 06: 15,760 -> 01: 06: 21,940
But Sanni has a different perspective.
She believes that happiness is the meaning of life.

647
01: 06: 22,240 -> 01: 06: 28,560
Be with others and enjoy themselves.
For me, it's about achieving something.

648
01: 06: 30,320 -> 01: 06: 37,320
Anyone can enjoy themselves and be happy.
It does not make the world a better place.

649
01: 06: 40,080 -> 01: 06: 43,760
Nobody achieves anything by enjoying themselves.

650
01: 06: 45,720 -> 01: 06: 50,600
You don't want to
stand in the way of the goals of others.

651
01: 06: 51,240 -> 01: 06: 56,900
And I have big problems with that
to understand why he wants to do this.

652
01: 06: 57,200 -> 01: 07: 02,600
But that is his dream.
This is what he really wants.

653
01: 07: 05,800 -> 01: 07: 08,740
It's about being a warrior.

654
01: 07: 09,040 -> 01: 07: 15,440
Not about the goal, but about doing their best
to follow the path you have chosen.

655
01: 07: 17,520 -> 01: 07: 21,720
You confront the fear
because the goal requires it.

656
01: 07: 21,840 -> 01: 07: 24,240
It's the warrior's spirit.

657
01: 07: 26,280 -> 01: 07: 30,500
I think the Freemason's mindset
similar to the warrior's.

658
01: 07: 30,800 -> 01: 07: 35,400
It is literally vital
to maintain full focus.

659
01: 07: 48,400 -> 01: 07: 51,760
Spring 2017.

660
01: 07: 54,480 -> 01: 07: 57,560
Step 6.

661
01: 08: 05,600 -> 01: 08: 09,860
That's where I gave up last year.
Right foot on this furrow.

662
01: 08: 10,160 -> 01: 08: 14,360
I had to trust
that the grip on the right foot held.

663
01: 08: 14,480 -> 01: 08: 21,040
I didn't really want to
to bet life on this one point of view.

664
01: 08: 22,440 -> 01: 08: 25,800
But maybe there is another way.

665
01: 08: 30,960 -> 01: 08: 34,760
I think this is the essence
throughout the program.

666
01: 08: 35,840 -> 01: 08: 41,520
Something interesting.
But with rope it is not at all.

667
01: 09: 10,960 -> 01: 09: 13,600
This is another variant.

668
01: 09: 16,480 -> 01: 09: 19,320
I still don't quite know.

669
01: 09: 25,240 -> 01: 09: 29,420
He just feels confident
to climb in front of the camera -

670
01: 09: 29,720 -> 01: 09: 34,100
- or in front of others
 when he is in complete control.

671
01: 09: 34,400 -> 01: 09: 38,740
And that has been the dilemma
for production all the way.

672
01: 09: 39,040 -> 01: 09: 45,460
We cannot help but influence him.
What is crucial is that he turned last year.

673
01: 09: 45,760 -> 01: 09: 52,420
He didn't feel pressured
having to do it because we were there.

674
01: 09: 52,720 -> 01: 09: 57,360
- It told me a lot.
- It meant a lot.

675
01: 10: 14,360 -> 01: 10: 18,740
Would you rather we not film it?

676
01: 10: 19,040 -> 01: 10: 21,620
No, I mean ...

677
01: 10: 21,920 -> 01: 10: 26,220
For me it is more important
to do it than to film it.

678
01: 10: 26,520 -> 01: 10: 30,420
-You can put your foot down whenever you want.
-I know.

679
01: 10: 30,720 -> 01: 10: 36,460
I can do it on my own terms
if I will. There is a possibility.

680
01: 10: 36,760 -> 01: 10: 39,500
But that wouldn't be real.

681
01: 10: 39,800 -> 01: 10: 45,000
What if you suddenly decided
why it wasn't that important?

682
01: 10: 45,120 -> 01: 10: 51,700
- Did you fail to get so good?
- I could do it. Ran away. But ...

683
01: 10: 52,000 -> 01: 10: 55,800
I don't feel like it.

684
01: 11: 00,480 -> 01: 11: 03,880
23rd stage.

685
01: 11: 07,000 -> 01: 11: 13,600
With so many others present you need
greater security, even more preparation.

686
01: 11: 13,360 -> 01: 11: 18,960
I don't have to grind it to it
does matter who is watching.

687
01: 11: 18,720 -> 01: 11: 23,400
It must be so easy for me
that I can do just that.

688
01: 11: 23,920 -> 01: 11: 27,900
"First stage.
 Keep left toward the top. Safer. "

689
01: 11: 28,200 -> 01: 11: 32,140
"Second stage.
 Trust your right foot. Grab from the bottom. "

690
01: 11: 32,440 -> 01: 11: 37,340
"Eight. Fine scrubbing.
 Nine. Avoid the descent. Beware of stone. "

691
01: 11: 37,640 -> 01: 11: 43,020
Step 26 "Lean into the corner. Pinch."
 with the left hand. Right foot to furrow. "

692
01: 11: 43,320 -> 01: 11: 48,180
"Left foot to the wall. Get up.
 Left hand to stone lump. "

693
01: 11: 48,480 -> 01: 11: 52,980
"Right hand after.
 Wedge your left foot into the crack. "

694
01: 11: 53,280 -> 01: 11: 58,460
"Left hand into y-shaped crack.
 Tie or hold as a plug. "

695
01: 11: 58,760 -> 01: 12: 04,500
"Get down to this one. Cross right
 hand under. Right foot down to edge. "

696
01: 12: 04,800 -> 01: 12: 10,420
"Left foot through to the next edge.
 Right back, drop down to the corner. "

697
01: 12: 10,720 -> 01: 12: 16,220
"Left foot out to big horn.
 Right hand to small recess. "

698
01: 12: 16,520 -> 01: 12: 20,740
"Slide your foot into the corner.
 Pinch with your right hand. "

699
01: 12: 21,040 -> 01: 12: 26,140
"Move to the opposite chasm.
 Change foot position, stracks for elevation. "

700
01: 12: 26,440 -> 01: 12: 32,060
"Key to Crux: pull hard, chair
 on the feet. "Underlined. Two exclamation points.

701
01: 12: 32,360 -> 01: 12: 35,880
Dot. "Autopilot."

702
01: 12: 55,800 -> 01: 13: 02,400
So, it's no wonder that Ueli died.
He drove with insanely dangerous things.

703
01: 13: 02,160 -> 01: 13: 05,760
But I thought he would survive.

704
01: 13: 07,520 -> 01: 13: 13,120
Ueli talked about climbing difficult
parties once a little kicked.

705
01: 13: 12,880 -> 01: 13: 18,980
I've always tried to avoid it.
But when I discussed Freerider with him,

706
01: 13: 19,280 -> 01: 13: 23,700
- I wondered if it was
 a leg I should take on the kick.

707
01: 13: 24,000 -> 01: 13: 26,100
Obituary: Oil plug.

708
01: 13: 26,400 -> 01: 13: 29,880
He obviously had bad luck that day.

709
01: 13: 38,360 -> 01: 13: 44,500
It was interesting to see
how Alex toned it down when Ueli died.

710
01: 13: 44,800 -> 01: 13: 48,720
He shrugged.
"Yes, that can happen."

711
01: 13: 53,400 -> 01: 13: 56,580
Alex and I have been discussing it for a long time.

712
01: 13: 56,880 -> 01: 14: 01,180
"What if you get killed?
 Like Ueli was killed? "

713
01: 14: 01,480 -> 01: 14: 07,780
Ueli and his wife, Nicole, had
close ties. They went on climbing trips together.

714
01: 14: 08,080 -> 01: 14: 13,020
At one point Alex said:
"What was she expecting?"

715
01: 14: 13,320 -> 01: 14: 17,520
I was totally ... "What do you mean by that ?!"

716
01: 14: 17,640 -> 01: 14: 22,040
“I’m Nicole, Alex.
 I don't expect anything like that! "

717
01: 14: 23,400 -> 01: 14: 29,540
Many more have been killed. The most
likely Alex will be the next one.

718
01: 14: 29,840 -> 01: 14: 35,040
But he's going to do it anyway.
I have to try to help him.

719
01: 14: 39,400 -> 01: 14: 44,980
It would be worse for me if
I hadn't helped him, and he fell.

720
01: 14: 45,280 -> 01: 14: 51,400
I am one of those who can do
mostly to him, so then I should.

721
01: 14: 58,720 -> 01: 15: 03,600
He says he has
the feeling of being serious soon.

722
01: 15: 04,680 -> 01: 15: 07,360
Maybe he'll try tomorrow.

723
01: 15: 11,280 -> 01: 15: 13,620
There are remote controlled cameras.

724
01: 15: 13,920 -> 01: 15: 19,560
We try to stay outside
Alex's field of view as he climbs.

725
01: 15: 20,280 -> 01: 15: 26,400
So everyone knows what we do if things go wrong:
Josh, repeat who Mikey should call.

726
01: 15: 27,200 -> 01: 15: 32,180
The easiest way is to dial the emergency number.
Then it gets going.

727
01: 15: 32,480 -> 01: 15: 36,440
- Tell them what you know.
-A climbing accident.

728
01: 15: 36,960 -> 01: 15: 40,640
Okay.
No mistakes tomorrow.

729
01: 15: 50,320 -> 01: 15: 54,100
I'm afraid it's over tomorrow.

730
01: 15: 54,400 -> 01: 15: 57,220
So, that ...

731
01: 15: 57,520 -> 01: 16: 01,780
Alex's life is going to be over.

732
01: 16: 02,080 -> 01: 16: 07,200
I must be prepared for that.
Realize that it is fully possible.

733
01: 16: 24,560 -> 01: 16: 29,740
- Do you remember saying goodbye?
-Oh, is it now?

734
01: 16: 30,040 -> 01: 16: 34,160
You don't have to get up,
just sit upright.

735
01: 16: 36,720 -> 01: 16: 41,600
- You could have just left.
-I never thought of leaving.

736
01: 16: 43,880 -> 01: 16: 46,360
Drive carefully.

737
01: 16: 46,800 -> 01: 16: 49,140
Good bye!

738
01: 16: 49,440 -> 01: 16: 51,760
See you later.

739
01: 17: 05,160 -> 01: 17: 09,940
I didn't ask her to leave.
Would never do that.

740
01: 17: 10,240 -> 01: 17: 15,480
But she realizes it is
easier for me if she's gone.

741
01: 17: 19,160 -> 01: 17: 24,660
But this whole parting ...
We will meet again in a few days.

742
01: 17: 24,960 -> 01: 17: 28,160
It's just goodbye for a few days.

743
01: 17: 33,280 -> 01: 17: 37,900
It is clear that the vicious idea of ​​...

744
01: 17: 38,200 -> 01: 17: 41,760
"Just not that was our last squeeze."

745
01: 17: 45,160 -> 01: 17: 48,520
Right?
I shouldn't think.

746
01: 17: 53,240 -> 01: 17: 56,120
But what if something happens?

747
01: 17: 57,120 -> 01: 18: 00,200
What if I never see him again?

748
01: 18: 01,800 -> 01: 18: 04,620
Why does he have to do it?

749
01: 18: 04,920 -> 01: 18: 08,400
It is an absolutely insane goal in life.

750
01: 19: 42,800 -> 01: 19: 45,300
<i> Hi, Jimmy. Do you hear me? </ I>

751
01: 19: 45,600 -> 01: 19: 51,120
Jimmy here.
He just started the ascent. </ I>

752
01: 20: 19,080 -> 01: 20: 22,640
Step 6.
146 meters.

753
01: 20: 28,880 -> 01: 20: 34,200
It's very smooth there.
That was where he last got himself.

754
01: 21: 32,280 -> 01: 21: 35,420
Mikey, do you hear me? This is Jimmy.

755
01: 21: 35,720 -> 01: 21: 38,220
I hear you, Jimmy. </ I>

756
01: 21: 38,520 -> 01: 21: 42,340
Can you notify when
he has passed Freeblast?

757
01: 21: 42,640 -> 01: 21: 46,940
-He has passed Freeblast. </ I>
- Does he have it?

758
01: 21: 47,240 -> 01: 21: 49,820
Yes, he's approaching Half Dollar. </ I>

759
01: 21: 50,120 -> 01: 21: 52,600
He keeps a high pace.

760
01: 21: 54,320 -> 01: 21: 57,740
Yes, Jimmy. </ I>
He's obviously ahead of schedule. </ I>

761
01: 21: 58,040 -> 01: 21: 59,980
June 3, 2017.

762
01: 22: 00,280 -> 01: 22: 03,880
How far away from Mammoth is he?

763
01: 22: 03,640 -> 01: 22: 06,440
He's in Half Dollar now.

764
01: 22: 22,640 -> 01: 22: 27,840
06.21. He climbs down
to the Heart Ledge. There it is people.

765
01: 22: 31,760 -> 01: 22: 35,380
They are awake.
And they are aware of it.

766
01: 22: 35,680 -> 01: 22: 38,580
"Here comes Honnold."
 Oh my!

767
01: 22: 38,880 -> 01: 22: 41,440
A guy in rabbit costume.

768
01: 22: 45,800 -> 01: 22: 48,100
He is getting up now.

769
01: 22: 48,400 -> 01: 22: 51,660
No, he has a tail.

770
01: 22: 51,960 -> 01: 22: 56,560
It's either a chicken head or a rabbit.

771
01: 22: 56,320 -> 01: 22: 58,180
It's a unicorn.

772
01: 22: 58,480 -> 01: 23: 04,080
What? Who thinks of something like that?
I've never seen it on El Capitan before.

773
01: 23: 06,480 -> 01: 23: 12,080
-And Alex has climbed on.
-He goes into Hollow Flake at. 06.49.

774
01: 23: 11,840 -> 01: 23: 16,420
He has climbed down
to Hollow Flake and is there now.

775
01: 23: 16,720 -> 01: 23: 20,220
Step 14.
304 meters.

776
01: 23: 20,520 -> 01: 23: 25,120
The thing with Freerider is
that from the foot of Hollow Flake -

777
01: 23: 24,880 -> 01: 23: 30,120
- there are continuous cracks
 all the way up, over 600 meters.

778
01: 23: 31,200 -> 01: 23: 35,440
It is the most magnificent
the mountain crack on the globe.

779
01: 23: 42,800 -> 01: 23: 48,560
Doug, this is Jimmy. Have we been told </i>
<i> if he has reached Monster Offwidth? </ I>

780
01: 23: 49,640 -> 01: 23: 52,400
Yes, he's there now. </ I>

781
01: 24: 24,080 -> 01: 24: 26,880
He's almost done with it.

782
01: 24: 41,160 -> 01: 24: 46,620
-Now he's on his way out of it.
- He's on par with Spire now.

783
01: 24: 46,920 -> 01: 24: 51,020
Is everyone in position and ready for admission?

784
01: 24: 51,320 -> 01: 24: 55,580
Yes, Sam and I are
<i> at the foot of the top wall. </ I>

785
01: 24: 55,880 -> 01: 25: 00,360
I wish he would reach
Boulder Problem about a neighborhood.

786
01: 25: 16,600 -> 01: 25: 20,080
23rd stage.
624 meters.

787
01: 26: 34,280 -> 01: 26: 37,400
He has completed the karate kick.

788
01: 26: 40,160 -> 01: 26: 42,040
He made it.

789
01: 26: 50,240 -> 01: 26: 54,040
- It was way too exciting.
-Oh my God.

790
01: 26: 57,360 -> 01: 27: 02,680
- He coped with the Boulder Problem.
-He's probably real gira now.

791
01: 27: 04,240 -> 01: 27: 09,560
He has passed
the smooth mountain walls and the Boulder Problem.

792
01: 27: 11,920 -> 01: 27: 14,800
Now he's in Enduro.

793
01: 27: 52,160 -> 01: 27: 55,900
I don't think you dare look at it.

794
01: 27: 56,200 -> 01: 27: 59,000
Oh, I can't stand it.

795
01: 28: 11,800 -> 01: 28: 14,960
Step 27.
762 meters.

796
01: 28: 22,480 -> 01: 28: 24,560
Oh my God.

797
01: 28: 33,520 -> 01: 28: 38,940
-Yes, he's pretty exposed.
-He's very exposed.

798
01: 28: 39,240 -> 01: 28: 44,680
The traverse around that edge is
one of the most dangerous parties on El Capitan.

799
01: 28: 47,120 -> 01: 28: 51,080
Below is the free fall.

800
01: 29: 42,680 -> 01: 29: 44,680
Hi true!

801
01: 29: 45,680 -> 01: 29: 50,500
-This is the best day of Alex's life.
-I do not quite know.

802
01: 29: 50,800 -> 01: 29: 57,320
That doesn't apply to me. I have had enough.
I will never repeat this.

803
01: 30: 00,360 -> 01: 30: 02,360
I have had enough.

804
01: 32: 01,800 -> 01: 32: 06,400
31st stage.
Last requested, 908 meters.

805
01: 32: 06,160 -> 01: 32: 08,080
Now it's over.

806
01: 32: 12,720 -> 01: 32: 15,920
Oh my God! He made it!

807
01: 32: 19,320 -> 01: 32: 21,520
Oh my God.

808
01: 32: 24,640 -> 01: 32: 29,560
-Oh my!
-Oh my God. Imagine that I got to experience this.

809
01: 33: 06,600 -> 01: 33: 11,960
-Oh God.
-Good to see you guys.

810
01: 33: 18,600 -> 01: 33: 21,420
I am so happy.

811
01: 33: 21,720 -> 01: 33: 25,500
It feels so good.
Fuck me raw.

812
01: 33: 25,800 -> 01: 33: 30,480
At least I'm extremely relieved,
I must admit that.

813
01: 33: 33,160 -> 01: 33: 35,760
So happy.

814
01: 33: 37,600 -> 01: 33: 40,960
-For a trip.
-Yes.

815
01: 33: 42,360 -> 01: 33: 46,020
Unimaginable.
After dreaming about it for eight years ...

816
01: 33: 46,320 -> 01: 33: 50,680
It's Sanni calling. Hello?

817
01: 33: 54,120 -> 01: 33: 58,420
-Yes, I'm so happy.
- To put it mildly. </ I>

818
01: 33: 58,720 -> 01: 34: 02,180
I've never smiled so wide before.

819
01: 34: 02,480 -> 01: 34: 07,140
<i> I want to see that smile! </ I>
That's why I'm calling. </ I>

820
01: 34: 07,440 -> 01: 34: 11,220
I've never cried like that before. </ I>
<i> Totally unexpected. </ I>

821
01: 34: 11,520 -> 01: 34: 15,500
<i> When I heard your voice, I was just ... </i>

822
01: 34: 15,800 -> 01: 34: 22,020
Yes, I am also in danger of crying a little.
I feel quite touched.

823
01: 34: 22,320 -> 01: 34: 27,700
No, not cry, Sanni. Don't get me
to cry, even if Claire wants it.

824
01: 34: 28,000 -> 01: 34: 34,480
Tears certainly do well on film.
But I don't feel like it. Yes, maybe a little.

825
01: 34: 36,000 -> 01: 34: 40,360
-I'm so
